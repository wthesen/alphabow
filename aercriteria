Introduction 
1.1 
Purpose of This Directive 
Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools was first published in 2011 and 
amalgamated information about pipelines into one directive. This information previously resided in 
other Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) directives, informational letters (ILs), interpretive 
documents, and reference tools. 
This directive provides testing and operational requirements for ensuring pipelines, including 
temporary pipelines, are operated safely and in accordance with regulations and industry standards. 
In this directive, defined terms are set in boldface at first use, and the definitions are provided 
in appendix 1. 
1.2 
AER Requirements 
Following AER requirements is mandatory for the responsible duty holder as specified in 
legislation (e.g., licensee, operator, company, applicant, approval holder, or permit holder). The 
term “must” indicates a requirement, while terms such as “should,” “recommends,” and “expects” 
indicate a recommended practice. 
Each AER requirement that is unique to this directive is numbered. 
Information on compliance and enforcement can be found on the AER website. 
1.3 
What’s New in This Edition 
Based on revisions to the Pipeline Rules, some detail has been moved from the rules to 
Directive 077 to better accommodate the technical explanation required. In addition, the directive 
has been updated to reflect changes to the CSA standard CSA Z662: Oil and gas pipeline systems 
(latest edition). 
Changes have been made to the directive to improve its overall clarity; other specific changes 
include the following: 
• Restored corrosion barrier requirements because CSA Z662 no longer requires mandatory 
corrosion barriers under insulation. 
• Specified responsibility for overpressure protection where more than one licensee is involved. 
• Revised the 21-day temporary surface pipeline (TSP) requirements to allow use for 
bypass situations. 
• Clarified the test period and expectations for TSP application and site restoration. 
Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 1 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
• Added a new section for water transfer by TSPs outlining the approval process and use of TSPs 
to transfer large volumes of water, such as for well fracturing. 
• Removed International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards of design for 
high-performance bimodal high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe. 
• Revised pressure testing requirements for gaseous media and the need for an engineering 
assessment to approve large test volumes. 
• Adjusted the limits for overpressure protection to agree with those in CSA Z662. 
• Moved interpretation and guidelines information into the appendices with reworked 
explanations, tables, and diagrams. 
• Added a new section, “Commingling of Oil and Gas in a Single Pipeline,” to clarify the 
circumstances when it may be possible to license pipelines for commingled production. 
• Added the following new forms: 
− Pipeline Pressure Testing Using Liquid Test Media Other Than Fresh Water 
− Pipeline Pressure Testing Using Gaseous Test Media 
− Temporary Surface Pipeline for Well Testing or Bypass 
− TSPW Group 1 Water Notice of Deployment 
− TSPW Group 2/3 Water Approval Request 
− TSPW Group 2/3 Water Notice of Deployment 
− TSPW Group 1/2/3 Water Amendment 
− TSPW Operations Summary 
• Made all forms available in OneStop.

Alberta Energy Regulator 
External Corrosion Prevention Coatings Under Pipeline Insulation 
2.1 
CSA Z662 Requirements 
Clause 9 of CSA Z662 requires an external corrosion prevention coating for steel pipelines that 
are buried, submerged, or exposed to the environment. However, CSA Z662 is not specific on 
whether insulation systems are considered a corrosion prevention coating. For buried pipelines, the 
insulation system is exposed to subsurface water and aboveground pipelines are exposed to 
precipitation and physical damage. Both are subject to water ingress, which can result in corrosion 
under insulation. Corrosion under insulation can also occur on elevated-temperature pipelines when 
they are not in service or when trapped water cannot escape from water-saturated insulation. 
Therefore, the AER concludes that common insulation systems are not considered effective 
corrosion prevention coatings. Consequently, new or modified steel pipelines, other than elevated
temperature pipelines registered with ABSA in accordance with section 9 of Directive 077, must 
have a corrosion prevention coating as described in clause 9 of CSA Z662 applied directly to the 
steel pipe. 
1) Unless otherwise authorized by the AER, an applicant for a licence for a new or modified 
insulated pipeline that is buried, submerged, on surface racking, or temporarily laid on the 
ground must ensure a corrosion prevention coating is applied directly to the surface of the 
steel pipe. 
The AER recognizes that the high operating temperature of some pipelines may exceed the 
operating range of some corrosion prevention coatings or that cases might occur where a corrosion 
prevention coating is not appropriate. Applicants may use alternative corrosion prevention 
systems once the AER has approved an exemption. 
2) To request an exemption from requirement 1, a licensee must submit the following to the AER 
at pipelineoperations@aer.ca: 
a) An engineering assessment that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the AER that the 
insulation and the alternate corrosion prevention system will provide effective long-term 
corrosion control. 
b) A description of the methods and actions in the integrity management program used to 
monitor for corrosion or cracking under insulation and respond to any concerns. 
3) The integrity management program referenced in requirement 2 must include measures for 
monitoring potential stress-corrosion cracking that may occur under wet insulation. 
Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 3 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
For more information on corrosion control for steel pipelines, see: 
• Bulletin 2021-36, Stress-Corrosion Cracking on Insulated High-Temperature Pipelines 
• CSA Z662: Oil and gas pipeline systems, clause 14.6 
• CSA Z245.22: Plant-applied external polyurethane foam insulation coating for steel pipe 
2.2 
Exemption for Elevated-Temperature Pipelines 
Elevated-temperature pipelines registered with ABSA in accordance with section 9 of Directive 077 
must be managed in accordance with an ABSA-approved pressure equipment integrity management 
system, as noted in section 9.6 of Directive 077. 
Requirement 1, corrosion prevention coating for an insulated pipeline, does not apply to ABSA
registered elevated-temperature pipelines. However, licensees of such pipelines should consider the 
potential for corrosion under insulation and stress-corrosion cracking.

High-Performance High-Density Polyethylene Pipe in Oil and Gas Service 
The previous edition of Directive 077 included a process for using high-performance bimodal 
HDPE pipe in oil and gas service. This type of pipe required design using ISO standards rather than 
the more familiar American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) design standards adopted by 
CSA Z662. The ASTM standards have since been revised to include this class of HDPE material. 
Changes to clause 13.3 of CSA Z662 now recognize the ASTM changes and allow for the use of 
higher-performance polyethylene pipe designated as type 4710. Because this change serves the 
industry’s needs, the section on ISO design has been removed from Directive 077. Amendments or 
additions to existing licences of HDPE pipe installed using ISO methodology are still permissible. 
Overpressure Protection for Pipelines Connected to Artificial Lift Equipment 
Unless otherwise authorized by the AER, clause 4.18 of CSA Z662 and section 31 of the Pipeline 
Rules require both pressure control and overpressure protection systems for pipelines where a 
source may overpressure the pipeline. 
This section describes acceptable variations to the requirements for overpressure protection for 
pipelines connected to artificial lift equipment (i.e., any method or device that enhances production 
flow from the well). The accepted variations apply only to pipelines connected to artificial lift 
equipment. All other pipelines must follow the requirements of CSA Z662. 
4) Where artificial lift equipment is capable of supplying pressure exceeding the pipeline’s 
maximum operating pressure (MOP), the licensee must implement one of the 
following options: 
4 Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 
a) Option 1: 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
i) 
Use two independently operated overpressure protection devices designed to stop the 
pressure from exceeding the licensed MOP. 
ii) Ensure the first overpressure protection device will independently stop the pressure 
from exceeding the licensed MOP, and the second overpressure protection device will 
independently stop the pressure from exceeding the licensed MOP by more than 10% 
or 35 kilopascals (kPa), whichever is greater, as described in CSA Z662. 
iii) Inspect, assess, and test the devices in accordance with the requirements of CSA Z662 
or, optionally, in accordance with a schedule developed and fully documented under 
the licensee’s integrity management program. 
b) Option 2: 
i) 
Use a single overpressure protection device designed to stop the pressure from 
exceeding the licensed MOP. 
ii) Ensure a competent individual conducts a monthly inspection and service test on the 
single overpressure protection device. 
iii) Have a certified instrumentation technician or equivalent inspect the single 
overpressure protection device annually (but not more than 18 months between 
inspections) to confirm the monthly inspections, assessments, and service testing were 
correctly conducted and that the device is not defective or inoperative. 
5) If any overpressure protection device is found to be defective or inoperative, the licensee must 
stop operations of the pipeline and repair or replace the device before continuing with 
operations. 
6) For all overpressure protection devices, the licensee must 
a) maintain logs of inspection, assessment, and tests in accordance with its integrity 
management program and this requirement, and 
b) provide those logs to the AER on request. 
At locations where the pipeline licensee and well licensee are different, if not defined by an 
agreement between the licensees, the pipeline licensee is responsible for ensuring the protection of 
the pipeline from artificial lift equipment.

Pipeline Pressure Testing Using Liquid Test Media Other Than Fresh Water 
Hydrostatic pressure testing is used to qualify new pipeline construction or requalify an existing 
pipeline by confirming the pipeline has the necessary strength and has no leaks. 
Fresh water is the preferred medium for pressure testing pipelines due to its benign effects on the 
environment should a leak occur. A freezing-point depressant, such as methanol or glycol, may be 
added to prevent the water from freezing when temperatures are below freezing. 
The use of normally transported pipeline fluids may be acceptable for pipeline pressure testing in 
certain situations. It is recommended that these fluids should only be used when technical 
considerations make the use of fresh water as the test media impractical or when the test pressure is 
less than the MOP and is being monitored for a period to confirm leak tightness. 
In addition to the requirements of this section, the licensee must apply the requirements for pressure 
testing set out in clause 8 of CSA Z662 and Part 3 of the Pipeline Rules. 
7) Where a licensee intends to test a pipeline using a liquid test medium other than fresh water, the 
licensee must, before starting the pressure test, prepare a contingency plan as required under 
clause 8.7.2 of CSA Z662 to protect the environment in the event of a release or spill of the 
liquid test medium. 
8) The licensee must provide a copy of its contingency plan to the AER on request. 
9) In addition to requirement 7, if the pressure test meets any of the following criteria: 
• the volume of the test section will exceed 500 cubic metres (m3), 
• the hoop stress level during the pressure test will exceed 100% specified minimum yield 
strength (SMYS), or 
• the pipeline will cross or pass within 100 metres (m) of flowing water at the time of the 
pressure test, 
the licensee must, 
a) before the start of pressure testing, ensure the contingency measures described in the 
contingency plan are staged at the worksite and ready to respond to any release or spill of 
the liquid test medium; 
b) before starting the pressure test, notify the AER by submitting via OneStop a completed 
Pipeline Pressure Testing Using Liquid Test Media Other Than Fresh Water form at least 
48 hours in advance; 
c) have a copy of the completed form at the test location during pressure testing; and 
6 Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
d) keep a record of the completed form in accordance with the requirements of the licensee’s 
Safety And Loss Management System and integrity management program. 
10)  If any information from requirement 9 changes, the licensee must notify the AER via OneStop 
of the change and also resubmit the form (Pipeline Pressure Testing Using Liquid Test Media 
Other than Fresh Water) via OneStop as soon as possible. 
6 
Pipeline Pressure Testing Using Gaseous Test Media 
Hydrostatic pressure testing is used to qualify new pipeline construction or requalify an existing 
pipeline by confirming the pipeline has the necessary strength and is leak tight. 
Fresh water is the preferred medium for pressure testing pipelines due to its incompressibility and 
benign effects on the environment should a leak occur. In specific circumstances, it may be 
necessary or advantageous to use air or other gaseous media as an alternative to water. 
However, the compressibility of gaseous test media can result in difficulties in interpreting the leak 
tightness of a pipeline. Minor leaks may be masked by the compressibility of the test medium. For 
this reason, limitations are placed on the volume of test sections, and test durations are extended to 
give more time for a leak to become apparent. It may be possible to conduct gaseous media tests on 
larger test volumes as described in the following requirements. Accordingly, the licensee must first 
complete an engineering assessment that evaluates the compressibility of the media and the 
sensitivity of the test to establish a satisfactory test duration that would enable the successful 
determination of leak tightness. 
Pressure tests using gaseous media present a higher risk to personnel and property near the pipeline. 
A test failure may result in violent releases of stored energy. For this reason, additional safety 
precautions must be used. Licensees considering the use of gaseous media pressure tests must 
follow the pertinent parts of CSA Z662 and Part 3 of the Pipeline Rules. Gaseous media testing is 
strongly discouraged in densely populated areas or for testing pipelines that have been in service. 
The conditions described below must be met to use gaseous test media, including limitations on the 
pipeline pressure and allowable stresses. 
AER Directive 060: Upstream Petroleum Industry Flaring, Incinerating, and Venting places 
restrictions on the amount of natural gas to be flared or vented and imposes public notification 
guidelines for flaring of gas used as a test medium. 
Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 7 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
11) The licensee must notify the AER via OneStop at least 48 hours before the start of a gaseous 
media pressure test. 
The AER may stop or prohibit a gaseous media pressure test if it believes the test might be 
inappropriate or constitute a safety hazard to personnel or the public. Testing may proceed once 
any concerns have been satisfactorily resolved. 
The AER recommends that licensees limit test segments to volumes of 125 m3 or less to enable 
successful leak detection when tested over a 24-hour period. 
12) For test volumes greater than 125 m3, licensees must follow note 2 of clause 8.7.5.3 of 
CSA Z662 and consider the effect of gas compressibility when determining the length of the test 
section and the duration of the test needed for successful detection of small leaks. 
13) Before conducting a gaseous media test using volumes greater than 125 m3, the licensee must 
notify the AER by submitting via OneStop a completed Pipeline Pressure Testing Using 
Gaseous Test Media form at least 48 hours in advance and include an engineering assessment 
in consideration of the test volume that demonstrates that the proposed testing procedure and 
duration are safe and will successfully detect a small leak. 
Figure 1 shows the approximate pipeline lengths for steel pipelines of different diameters that result 
in volumes of 125 m3. Licensees should use the actual measurements of the pipeline to calculate the 
volume accurately. 
Figure 1. 
Steel pipe lengths for 125 m3 volume 
14) The licensee must use high-resolution (i.e., better than 1%) pressure measurement instruments 
to detect minor pressure losses while testing. 
15) The licensee must maintain a hold period sufficient to allow the pipeline to fully stabilize after 
pressurization before beginning the 24-hour test period. 
16) The licensee must continuously monitor the pipeline’s ambient temperature and internal test 
section temperature during the test to allow reconciliation against pressure changes. 
The licensee may consider additional techniques to assist in leak detection, such as using an 
odorant, gas detectors, ultrasonic leak detectors, thermography, and trained animal detectors.

Alberta Energy Regulator 
Temporary Surface Pipelines for Well Testing or Bypass 
This section addresses the process for obtaining approval for a TSP for well testing or as a bypass. 
Such approvals are valid for 21 consecutive days beginning the first day of the temporary flow (i.e., 
in service) and expiring at midnight of the 21st day. Temporary interruptions of service will not 
extend the 21-day period. 
The AER may consider an extension beyond 21 days in extenuating circumstances for a critical 
bypass. 
Use of a surface pipeline as a production pipeline is not allowed except where the licensee applies 
under Directive 056: Energy Development Applications and Schedules for a surface pipeline, which 
may be licensed for up to one year. 
See section 8 of this directive for the requirements for TSPs conveying water. 
17) A duty holder intending to install and operate a TSP for well testing or bypass must obtain 
written AER approval before the construction or deployment of the pipeline. 
18) To request approval from the AER, the duty holder must 
a) complete the Temporary Surface Pipeline for Well Testing or Bypass form and submit the 
form to the AER via OneStop and, 
b) if requested, submit to the AER information that supports the statements made in the form. 
If a duty holder indicates “no” to any item on the form, the request will require further technical 
evaluation. Duty holders should include with the form an explanation for any “no” response 
and supporting evidence well before the intended pipeline construction date to ensure the AER 
has sufficient time to evaluate the application. 
Upon completing any technical evaluation, the AER field office will provide a disposition 
concerning the request. 
If the public involvement requirements cannot be met, the TSP for well testing or bypass 
approval process described in this directive cannot be used, and a Directive 056 pipeline licence 
must be obtained. 
19) The duty holder must keep a copy of the form and the AER’s consent at the pipeline location 
during installation through to remediation and reclamation of the pipeline right-of-way. 
20) A duty holder that has installed a TSP under the 21-day approval process must 
a) remove it within 30 calendar days of the expiry of the approval and 
Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 9 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
b) remediate and reclaim the pipeline right-of-way within 60 calendar days of the expiry of 
the approval. 
If necessary, contact the AER field office that issued the approval to request more time to 
remediate and reclaim the pipeline right-of-way. 
Duty holders proposing to use a TSP for well testing or bypass must comply with the requirements 
in sections 25 and 30(2)(4) of the Pipeline Rules for surface pipelines, despite these TSPs not 
being licensed. 
Duty holders proposing to use a TSP for well testing or bypass must comply with the requirements 
of CSA Z662, including the sour service requirements specified in clause 16.

Temporary Surface Pipelines for Water Conveyance 
This section addresses the authorization process and technical requirements for TSPs for water 
conveyance (TSPW) as defined in the Pipeline Rules, which are used to convey water to support 
energy development (e.g., well drilling, well completion, hydrostatic testing). The goals of the 
requirements are to ensure that no water conveyed through a TSPW is inadvertently released and 
the risk to public safety and the environment remains low for all uses of TSPWs. 
A TSPW may 
• convey only water or water-based liquids (see table 1 for water groups), 
• operate at a pressure of no more than 3500 kPa, 
• be deployed for a defined period not exceeding 12 months (unless approved for an extension of 
up to 12 months), and 
• be mostly on the ground surface; however, portions of the TSPW may be elevated, buried, or 
otherwise covered (e.g., for crossing waters or roadways). 
If a TSPW is intended to be deployed for more than 24 months from the date of deployment, the 
AER recommends constructing a permanent pipeline. 
The regulatory requirements for conveying water through TSPWs are proportional to their potential 
effect on public safety and the environment. Table 1 lists the permissible water groups for a TSPW. 
Mixtures of water from different groups (in any proportion) are classified as the highest-numbered 
group within the mix. Mixing of water groups must comply with applicable Government of Alberta 
policies and regulations. 
21) If a mixture of water groups is to be conveyed, the duty holder must know the chemical 
composition of the mixture. 
10 Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
Water containing constituents at levels that could be an immediate human health hazard if released 
is prohibited from being conveyed through a TSPW, including water with extreme pH (i.e., ≤2 or 
≥11.5) or water with unsafe levels of hydrogen sulphide (H2S), naturally occurring radioactive 
materials, or flammable or explosive constituents. 
Table 1. Water groups for TSPW conveyance 
Water 
group 
Description 
Criteria 
1 
Water with a negligible effect on 
the environment or public safety if 
released. 
Group 1 water comprises nonsaline surface water 
and nonsaline groundwater that meets the following 
criteria: 
• chloride content of no more than 500 milligrams 
per litre 
• electrical conductivity of no more than 
2.0 decisiemens per metre  
• pH between 6.0 and 9.0 
• no hydrocarbon sheen 
• does not contain municipal wastewater, water 
affected by an industrial process, or produced or 
process water from an oil or gas activity 
• has not had any chemical added before 
conveyance in the TSPW 
2 
Water that may have an 
environmental effect if released. 
The effect is generally easily and 
quickly reversible, and the risk to 
public safety is negligible. 
Group 2 water includes treated drinking water, final 
treated municipal or industrial effluent, and nonsaline 
surface water or nonsaline groundwater that does not 
meet the criteria for group 1 or 3 water. 
3 
Water that will have an 
environmental effect if released. 
The effect is not generally easily 
or quickly reversible, but the risk 
to public safety is low. 
Group 3 water includes saline groundwater, partially 
or untreated municipal or industrial wastewater, 
produced water, fracturing flowback water, liquid 
oilfield wastewater, and other water that does not 
meet the criteria for group 1 or 2 water. 
8.1 
Approval and Notification Process 
In accordance with sections 7(3)(b) and 7(4) of the Pipeline Rules, TSPWs are exempt from 
requiring a pipeline licence. However, approval from or notification to the AER is required 
depending on the group of water conveyed. 
22) Before submitting a notification for group 1 water or a request for approval for group 2 or 3 
water, the duty holder must have consent from all landowners (including municipalities) and 
occupants on whose property the TSPW will be deployed in accordance with requirement 35. 
23) A duty holder must have prior approval from the AER to convey water from a higher-numbered 
group through a TSPW authorized for a lower-numbered group. Use the TSPW Group 1/2/3 
Water Amendment form to request this change. 
Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 11 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
Once authorized to convey group 2 or 3 water, a TSPW may convey water from a lower-numbered 
group. The TSPW must remain in compliance with the existing approval except for the 
lower-numbered water group. 
The TSPW duty holder may consent, through a private agreement, to share the TSPW with another 
party. The original duty holder remains responsible for the TSPW and the required data collection, 
incident response, and end-of-operation obligations. 
24) If another duty holder seeks to assume responsibility for an existing deployed TSPW, they must 
follow the approval or notification processes appropriate to the water group as outlined below. 
In these cases, to ensure the deployment duration is not exceeded or changed, the duration of 
deployment will be measured from the date the original duty holder deployed the TSPW. 
Subsequent duty holders of existing TSPWs will be exempt from deployment and 
commissioning requirements. The last duty holder for the TSPW will be responsible for 
decommissioning the TSPW (section 8.5.8.1) and site restoration (section 8.5.8.2). 
8.1.1 Group 1 TSPW Deployment Notification 
25) A TSPW conveying group 1 water does not require AER approval. However, before starting 
any field activities related to deploying and operating the TSPW, the duty holder must notify 
the AER by submitting via OneStop a completed TSPW Group 1 Water Notice of Deployment 
form at least 24 hours in advance (but not more than 14 business days). 
8.1.2 Group 2 and 3 TSPW Approval

decommissioning and restoration of the TSPW route and provide it to the AER on request. 
8.5  
Technical Requirements 
8.5.1 Route Selection and TSPW Placement 
The goal is to install TSPWs in locations that pose minimal risk to public safety and the 
environment during all phases of use, particularly in the event of a release of conveyed water. 
The TSPW’s route should minimize the risk of environmental damage, including threats to the 
quality of soils, surface water, groundwater, and the health of humans, animals, and plants during 
the deployment, operation, and decommissioning of the TSPW. Routing of TSPWs is 
recommended to avoid crossing water bodies as defined in Directive 056. 
A TSPW and its associated equipment should be located as far as practicable from water bodies, 
water wells, and sensitive receptors. Moreover, the statement applies specifically to a TSPW and 
the associated equipment used to operate it (e.g., booster pumps), not the equipment like pumps 
needed to access or divert water from the source. 
The AER expects duty holders will minimize surface disturbance when installing and operating 
a TSPW. 
38) Unless otherwise authorized by the AER, where a TSPW route cannot avoid crossing a water 
body, the duty holder must ensure the TSPW meets the following requirements: 
14 Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
a) The TSPW is elevated and supported above the highest water level expected during the 
operation or is installed on a floating support system so that the duty holder may detect any 
leaks. Existing bridges are preferred crossing points, with the permission of the relevant 
bridge operator or owner. 
b) If conveying group 2 water, there are no pipe connections within 10 m of the water body. If 
this is not possible, the pipe connections must have devices or containment to collect and 
contain any leakage or redirect it to an area where it can be contained. 
c) If conveying group 3 water, secondary containment is placed along the TSPW, across and 
extending 10 m on each side of the water body to redirect any water released away from the 
water body to an area where it can be contained. 
For group 1 and 2 TSPWs, if the water body is reasonably expected to remain frozen during the 
time of deployment, operation, and removal (with ice of sufficient thickness to safely support the 
water-filled TSPW and the personnel and equipment needed to operate it), the AER may consider 
waiving requirement 38 if the duty holder provides an acceptable mitigation plan for potential 
incidents specific to the ice crossing. 
A TSPW may cross ephemeral water bodies that are reasonably expected to remain dry for the 
entire duration of the TSPW’s deployment. 
TSPWs may be deployed in man-made ditches that remain dry except during and immediately after 
precipitation. Duty holders are reminded that roadway ditches are often direct pathways to surface 
water bodies; appropriate surveillance and placement of spill mitigation equipment is an important 
consideration in designing the surveillance program for TSPWs routed in ditches. 
39) Unless the landowners, occupants, or entities in the care and control of the land previously 
agree, the duty holder must deploy a TSPW so as not to materially impair 
a) drainage (e.g., through drains, ditches, culverts, overland), 
b) vehicle safety, 
c) road and right-of-way maintenance (e.g., rutting that impairs vehicle safety, vegetation 
control, snow removal), or 
d) animal (domestic or wild) movement, feeding, or breeding. 
40) The duty holder must take appropriate measures to maintain access to land adjacent to the 
TSPW and protect the TSPW from damage or, if necessary, provide an alternative access point 
acceptable to the landowners, occupants, or entities in the care and control of the land. 
41) The duty holder must operate the TSPW in a manner that protects the public and the 
environment and in accordance with this directive and the Pipeline Rules. 
Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 15 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
The duty holder must comply with all applicable provisions as set out in section 2(4) of the 
Pipeline Rules. 
8.5.2 Materials 
The goal is to construct TSPWs using materials that minimize the risk to public safety and the 
environment from materials-related failures. 
42) The duty holder must construct the TSPW using materials (e.g., pipe, gaskets, seals, pipe 
connections) compatible with the water conveyed (e.g., chemical constituents) and the 
operating conditions (e.g., weather, temperature, duration, MOP). 
43) All TSPW materials and associated equipment must be maintained, installed, operated, and 
stored in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications and limitations. 
44) Unless authorized by the AER, all pipe connections must be designed to prevent separation 
caused by pipe vibration or movement or include other measures to prevent separation. 
45) Unless authorized by the AER, all pipe connections must include suitable restraints to prevent 
decoupled pipe ends from becoming a safety hazard in the event of failure. 
8.5.3 Deployment 
The goal is to deploy TSPWs and maintain the integrity of the materials while minimizing ground 
disturbance and having appropriate spill control and containment equipment in place to protect 
public safety and the environment in the event of a release. 
46) The duty holder must have a documented deployment procedure appropriate for the TSPW 
materials, the water group, and the quality of the water for conveyance that includes 
consideration of the following: 
a) ground surface preparation to protect the TSPW from possible damage 
b) material handling and installation procedures 
c) pipe connection instructions 
d) measures to minimize TSPW movement during operations 
e) measures to protect the TSPW when deployed 
f) deployment cleanup and route maintenance guidance (e.g., repair of ruts, vegetation 
control, etc.) 
Duty holders should include any additional information deemed necessary for successful 
deployment in their procedure. 
16 Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
47) The duty holder must keep a paper or electronic copy of the deployment procedure on site and 
provide it to the AER on request. 
48) Unless authorized by the AER, devices or containers to collect and contain potential leakage 
must be used at pipe connections when conveying group 3 water within 100 m of water bodies, 
water wells, or sensitive receptors. 
49) Pumping units for group 2 water TSPWs within 50 m of water bodies or water wells and all 
group 3 water TSPWs must be equipped with devices or containers to collect and contain 
potential leakage of conveyed water, fuel, or lubricants from the pumping unit. 
50) Unless authorized by the AER, a TSPW conveying group 2 or 3 water near water bodies, water 
wells, or sensitive receptors (within 50 m for group 2 and within 100 m for group 3) must be 
equipped with flow-stopping devices, such as valves, clamps, or crimping devices, placed 
within 100 m of the water body, water well, or sensitive receptor to shut off the flow and isolate 
portions of the TSPW to limit the volume of water released in the event of a leak. Where a 
TSPW parallels a water body within the distances given above, additional flow-stopping 
devices must be located a maximum of 500 m apart along the portion of the TSPW that 
parallels the water body and within 100 m of where the TSPW nears and moves away from the 
water body. 
51) Where the AER is satisfied that an effective barrier to water flow exists between the TSPW and 
a water body, water well, or sensitive receptor, requirements 48, 49, and 50 do not apply. Using 
the TSPW Group 2/3 Water Approval Request form, the duty holder must describe how 
existing barriers will prevent water flow from reaching water bodies, water wells, or sensitive 
receptors and indicate the barriers on the route map. 
For example, leakage collection devices at pipe connections (requirement 48) or at pumping 
units (requirement 49) and flow-stopping devices (requirement 50) may not be required for a 
TSPW deployed in a roadside ditch with a water body on the opposite side of the road, with no 
crossing culverts. 
52) Pumping units for group 2 and 3 water TSPWs must be equipped with automated shutdown 
devices set to quickly deactivate pumping when significant deviations in pressure are identified 
while minimizing nuisance trips and false alarms. 
53) The duty holder of a TSPW must install and maintain clearly visible and legible signage at 
appropriate locations along the TSPW route (e.g., water crossings, road crossings, and railway 
crossings and at ancillary equipment [unless nearby signage is visible from these locations]) 
that displays the following: 
a) company name and emergency phone number for the pipeline operator (if not the 
duty holder) 
Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 17 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
b) identification that the TSPW is a “Pressurized Water Pipeline” and the contents are “not 
potable” (further identification of the contents is optional) 
c)  applicable warnings (e.g., hazardous contents) 
54) The duty holder must maintain a log of deployment activities conducted and provide it to the 
AER on request. 
8.5.4 Commissioning 
The goal is to verify the integrity of the TSPW and its proper construction and deployment to 
minimize the risk of preventable leaks from material or installation issues. 
55) The duty holder must have a documented commissioning procedure appropriate for the TSPW 
materials, the water group, and the quality of the water for conveyance that includes the 
following: 
a) A visual inspection of the entire TSPW, all pipe connections, and associated equipment 
after the TSPW is deployed but before water is introduced. 
Air testing to a pressure not exceeding 210 kPa may be used as a screening method to 
identify any issues with pipeline integrity. Appropriate safety measures should be taken 
when using pressurized air. 
b) An integrity test to verify water containment:  
i) 
For group 1 and 2 water TSPWs, the integrity test must include the following:  
• A visual inspection during the initial fill of the TSPW (using group 1 or 2 water) to 
detect leaks as the leading edge of the water advances through the TSPW. Resolve 
any leaks before going to the next step. 
• Initiate the surveillance program immediately upon reaching operating pressure. 
ii) For group 3 TSPWs, the integrity test must include the following: 
•  A visual inspection during the initial fill of the TSPW (using group 1 or 2 water) to 
detect leaks as the leading edge of the water advances through the TSPW. Resolve 
any leaks before going to the next step. 
• A visual inspection of the entire TSPW immediately after it reaches operating 
pressure (with group 1 or 2 water). Water may continue to flow or be held. Resolve 
any leaks before going to the next step. 
• Initiate the surveillance program, introduce group 3 water, and start operations. 
c) Verification that all monitoring equipment and systems function properly. 
18 Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
Duty holders should include any additional information deemed necessary for successful 
commissioning in their procedure. 
56) The duty holder must successfully complete the commissioning procedures before putting the 
TSPW into operation. Commissioning is successful when integrity testing confirms no leaks 
and monitoring equipment and systems function properly. 
57) The duty holder must keep a paper or electronic copy of the commissioning procedure on site 
and provide it to the AER on request. 
58) The duty holder must maintain a log of commissioning activities carried out and provide it to 
the AER on request. 
The duty holder may follow the manufacturer’s recommended commissioning procedure if it is 
more rigorous than the directive. 
8.5.5 Operations 
The goal is to operate TSPWs consistent with material specifications and parameters and minimize 
the risk to public safety and the environment during operations. 
59) The duty holder must have a documented operating procedure appropriate for the TSPW 
materials, the water group, and the quality of the water for conveyance that includes the 
following: 
a) identification of the operating limits (e.g., pressure, flow rate, temperature, substance) 
given in the manufacturer’s specifications and the planned MOP 
b) instructions for safely operating pumping and monitoring equipment 
c) directions for conducting the surveillance program (see section 8.5.6) 
d) directions for implementing incident response (see section 8.5.7) 
e) directions for emptying and purging the TSPW 
f) considerations for operating the TSPW under anticipated weather conditions 
Duty holders should include any additional information deemed necessary for successful 
operation in their procedure. 
60) The duty holder must keep a paper or electronic copy of the operating procedure on site and 
provide it to the AER on request. 
61) An operations supervisor must be on site while the TSPW is pressurized. 
62) Chemicals or additives introduced to group 2 or 3 water must be identified on the TSPW Group 
2/3 Water Approval Request form. 
Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 19 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
63) When the active transfer of water through the TSPW is suspended for more than 24 hours, 
pressure must be relieved from the system. 
64) When a TSPW is out of service for more than seven days, it must be drained. 
65) If a TSPW conveying group 2 or 3 water has been drained, a thorough visual inspection of the 
pipeline and pipe connections must be completed immediately after refilling and 
repressurizing it. 
66) The duty holder must maintain a log of operational activities (e.g., pumping times, 
maintenance, repairs) carried out and provide it to the AER on request. 
8.5.6 Operations Surveillance 
The goal is to monitor TSPW operations to identify and correct risks as soon as possible and avoid 
or minimize potential effects on public safety and the environment. Effective surveillance supports 
continuous improvement in the various aspects of TSPW use, from planning to decommissioning. 
67) The duty holder must have a documented surveillance program appropriate for the TSPW 
materials, the water group, and the quality of the water for conveyance that considers the 
following hazards: 
a) water releases (e.g., drips, sprays, breaches, breaks) 
b) external damage that may indicate or lead to future integrity concerns (e.g., blisters, colour 
or opacity change, bulges, cuts, scratches, gouges, kinks, folds, third-party interference) 
c) internal damage (e.g., corrosion of couplings and fittings, abrasion) 
d) internal blockage (e.g., ice, slush, debris) 
e) blocked drainage, debris accumulation, flooding, and ponded water along the TSPW route 
f) TSPW movement (e.g., excessive rolling or snaking) 
g) effects on vegetation 
h) ground erosion 
i) 
any other hazard identified as part of the duty holder’s hazard identification process 
Regarding requirement c) above, the duty holder may perform this surveillance through spot 
checks or by following the manufacturer’s guidance. 
Duty holders should include any additional information deemed necessary in their program for 
successful surveillance. The surveillance program should consider aspects related to worker 
safety, such as traffic, wildlife, working alone, time of day, weather conditions, and other 
factors. Operations may need to be adjusted to ensure surveillance can be completed safely. 
20 Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
68) The surveillance program for group 2 and 3 water must be submitted with the TSPW Group 2/3 
Water Approval Request form. 
69) The duty holder must keep a paper or electronic copy of the surveillance program on site and 
provide it to the AER on request. 
70) The surveillance program must be active at all times the TSPW is pressurized. 
71) Visual observation and monitoring flow rate and pressure must be part of the surveillance 
program and scheduled at a frequency sufficient for the timely identification of potential 
hazards or incidents. 
72) Pressure monitoring of the TSPW must be sufficiently sensitive to indicate the presence of a 
leak requiring mitigation. Such pressure anomalies must be promptly investigated. 
73) Enhanced surveillance (i.e., more frequent visual inspection) is required for portions of a TSPW 
a) crossing water bodies (including wet ephemeral water bodies and draws and flowing 
ditches and drains) and 
b) when within 50 m (for group 1 and 2 water TSPWs) or 100 m (for group 3 water TSPWs) 
of a sensitive receptor. 
74) If surveillance activities identify the occurrence of a hazard identified in requirement 67, the 
duty holder must investigate and remedy (if necessary) in accordance with section 8.5.7. 
75) The duty holder must maintain a log of the surveillance activities carried out and provide it to 
the AER on request. 
8.5.7 Incident Response and Reporting 
For TSPWs, an incident is the occurrence of any hazard listed in requirement 67. The incident 
response and reporting requirements do not supersede or replace the Environmental Protection and 
Enhancement Act, Remediation Regulation, Conservation and Reclamation Regulation, Directive 
071: Emergency Preparedness and Response, or other relevant requirements. 
76) TSPW duty holders must follow the requirements for spill preparedness and response in 
sections 8 and 9 of Directive 071. 
77) The duty holder must keep a paper or electronic copy of the spill response plan on site and 
provide it to the AER on request. 
Duty holders are reminded that depending on the group of water being conveyed, provisions 
concerning release response under the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act may apply, 
including requirements for remedial work and reporting. For more information, see the AER’s 
release reporting webpage.

The 24-hour Environmental Response Line telephone number is 1-800-222-6514. 
78) The duty holder of a group 2 or 3 TSPW must maintain a log of incidents, near misses, or 
identified hazards noted during operations and submit it to the AER at the end of operations or 
on request by the AER (using the TSPW Operations Summary form) that includes the 
following information: 
a) location and time 
b) description of the incident and circumstances leading to its occurrence 
c) details of any action taken 
d) any outstanding follow-up measures 
79) If an incident other than water release occurs, the duty holder must initiate incident response 
within the following timeframes unless other legislation or regulation takes precedence: 
a) For incidents related to TSPW damage or blockage (i.e., hazards in requirement 67(b-d)), 
i) 
respond as soon as possible for TSPWs conveying group 1 water and 
ii) immediately for TSPWs conveying group 2 or 3 water. 
b) For incidents related to drainage and debris (i.e., hazards in requirement 67(e)), respond 
immediately regardless of the water group being conveyed. 
c) For incidents related to TSPW movement, effects on vegetation, erosion, or other identified 
hazards (i.e., hazards in requirement 67(f-i)), respond immediately if a safety hazard is 
created or as soon as practicable if a safety hazard is not created. 
8.5.8 End of Operations 
The end of operations occurs when the duty holder no longer needs the TSPW for water 
conveyance or the expiry of the notification or approval or any extension granted, whichever 
occurs first. 
80) If an AER suspension or abandonment order exists for any site connected to the TSPW, making 
continued use of the TSPW unfeasible, the duty holder must immediately start and complete the 
end-of-life obligations within the specified timeframes. 
8.5.8.1 
Decommissioning 
81) At the end of operations, the duty holder must drain and purge all water in the TSPW within

Alberta Energy Regulator 
82) The duty holder must remove the TSPW and its associated equipment within one month of the 
end of operations. If conditions prevent removal within the specified timeframe, the duty holder 
must initiate removal as soon as conditions permit. 
83) If removal is not possible within the specified timeframe (see requirement 82), the duty holder 
must inform the AER by submitting an extension request (see section 8.2). An extension for 
TSPW removal does not permit the duty holder to continue conveying water. 
8.5.8.2 
Site Restoration 
84) Within two months of the end of operations, the duty holder must restore the TSPW route to 
predeployment conditions (or a condition otherwise agreed to with the landowners, occupants 
or entities in the care and control of the land). If conditions prevent site restoration within the 
specified timeframe, the duty holder must initiate and complete restoration as soon as 
conditions permit. 
85) Such situations must be identified to the AER by submitting an extension request (see section 
8.2). An extension for TSPW site restoration does not permit the duty holder to continue 
conveying water. 
8.5.8.3 
Closeout Reporting

Elevated-Temperature Pipelines 
9.1 
Introduction 
Pipelines used in the recovery of hydrocarbons from a reservoir or oil sands deposit are a “pipeline” 
under the Pipeline Act. 
Elevated-temperature pipelines include 
• pipelines that only distribute steam at temperatures >120°C, 
• pipelines that operate in multiple services, including steam distribution at temperatures >120°C, 
or 
• pipelines for recovering produced fluids with recovered steam condensate from a reservoir at 
Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 23 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
temperatures >230°C. 
Based on the expected operating conditions, the duty holder's design engineer is responsible for 
determining if an elevated-temperature pipeline design is required. Refer to clause 14 (elevated
temperature pipelines) of CSA Z662 for more information. 
In Alberta, there is shared responsibility for licensing and design evaluation of pipelines 
distributing steam at design temperatures >120°C or recovering produced reservoir fluids at design 
temperatures >230°C. Where such pipelines relate to an oil or gas project under the jurisdiction of 
the AER, the AER is responsible for pipeline licensing. Through a memorandum of understanding 
with ABSA (the pressure equipment safety authority), ABSA is responsible for reviewing pipeline 
design, quality management, construction, pipeline integrity management program, and registering 
the design. Typically, applicants obtain design registration from ABSA before applying to the AER 
to construct the pipeline. 
CSA Z662 includes requirements for pipelines distributing steam at temperatures >120°C and 
pipelines recovering produced reservoir fluids at operating temperatures >230°C. Figure 14.1 of 
CSA Z662 illustrates this relationship in a flowchart. Also, the flowchart in appendix 3 of this 
directive further explains the applicability of AER-ABSA jurisdiction. Steam distribution pipelines 
at >120°C or other pipelines with a design temperature >230°C are subject to the design standards 
of clause 14 of CSA Z662 (elevated-temperature pipelines). If a pipeline is used only in steam 
distribution service (i.e., not multiple service or a production pipeline), Annex I Oilfield steam 
distribution pipelines – Alternate provisions (steam only) may be used as a design option. All other 
produced reservoir fluid pipelines with a design temperature ≤230°C may follow clause 4 of 
CSA Z662 design standards or, optionally, clause 14 design standards, as ABSA does not allow an 
existing AER-approved pipeline to be converted to steam distribution service unless the pipeline 
was originally registered for those services. 
9.2 
Exemptions 
Temporary steam distribution pipelines used in conjunction with an approved oil sands scheme do 
not require a licence under the Pipeline Act. For the AER’s purpose, temporary is defined as not 
exceeding six consecutive months of service. However, steam distribution pipelines of a capacity 
>0.5 m3 require ABSA design registration, regardless of the time they will be in service. Steam 
distribution pipelines of capacity ≤0.5 m3 do not require design registration under the Pressure 
Equipment Safety Regulation (PESR). 
Steam distribution pipelines confined strictly within the facility surface lease boundaries of a 
steam-generating plant, satellite, battery, or well site and steam manifolds and measuring facilities 
at multiwell satellites are considered to form pressure piping systems as defined in the PESR and 
do not require a licence under the Pipeline Act. ABSA requirements apply in these instances. 
24 Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 
9.3 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
Application for a Pipeline Licence 
For pipelines not covered under the exemption for temporary steam distribution pipelines and that 
traverse or enter land outside the facility surface lease boundaries of a plant, well site, satellite, or 
battery, the applicant must apply to the AER for a licence as required by Part 4 of the Pipeline Act. 
Under section 7(2) of the Pipeline Rules, and as part of the Directive 056 application, the AER 
requires confirmation that the design of elevated-temperature pipelines has been registered with 
ABSA in accordance with section 16 of the PESR. 
Pressure control and overpressure protection are to satisfy the requirements for overpressure 
protection of clause 4 of CSA Z662 and section 38 of the PESR. 
87) If mechanical couplings are used, the Directive 056 application must confirm the couplings are 
registered with ABSA. 
For more information on the applicability of ABSA design registration and AER licence 
application, see the flowchart in appendix 3 of this directive. 
9.4 
Field Construction and Inspection 
Notice of field construction must be provided to the AER, in accordance with section 9 of the 
Pipeline Rules. 
Construction quality control documentation is subject to ABSA piping construction quality 
authorization requirements. Environmental, licence, and ground disturbance inspections may be 
carried out by AER inspectors. Construction may be subjected to inspection by an ABSA Safety 
Codes Officer. 
9.5 
Pressure Testing 
Pressure testing requirements are specified in Part 3 of the Pipeline Rules and clause 14 of 
CSA Z662 or Annex I. 
Notice of pressure test must be provided to the AER in accordance with section 33 of the 
Pipeline Rules. 
Test pressures, mediums, and procedures must be approved by ABSA in accordance with sections 
16(1) and 30 of the PESR. Testing must be conducted in a manner that satisfies CSA Z662 and 
section 30 of the PESR. AER inspectors may require documentation of the successful pressure test. 
Records of the successful pressure test must be in accordance with the Pipeline Rules and 
sections 31 and 32 of the PESR.

In accordance with section 7(2) of the Pipeline Rules, a licensee must obtain all required approvals 
from ABSA before putting the pipeline into operation. 
In-service inspections and integrity management for the pipelines must be addressed in the pressure 
equipment integrity management system in a manner acceptable to ABSA. AER requirements for 
operation, maintenance, and integrity management of steam distribution pipelines and 
elevated-temperature pipelines are superseded by the stated ABSA requirements. As required under 
the Safety Codes Act, unsafe conditions and incidents not associated with a failure must be reported 
to ABSA. 
9.7 
Failure Investigation 
For elevated-temperature pipelines, failure is defined as a condition where product is released from 
the pipeline. However, for steam distribution pipelines only, a temporary fluid release caused by a 
leakage at flanges, packing glands, and similar fittings that can be terminated by mechanical 
adjustments, such as the tightening of bolts, is not considered a failure. 
A failure, as defined above, of a licensed pipeline must be reported immediately to the AER (see 
section 35 of the Pipeline Act) and to ABSA. ABSA will investigate the failure as a pressure 
equipment incident and provide the report conclusions to the AER. An AER inspector may conduct 
an on-site inspection concentrating on the environmental and emergency response aspects of any 
fluid loss. The AER may require additional information concerning spill containment, recovery 
procedures, and site rehabilitation (see section 67 of the Pipeline Rules). Notification to Alberta 
Environment and Protected Areas may also be required. 
ABSA and the AER may conduct a joint investigation within their respective areas of 
responsibility. If a failure causes the injury or death of any person, the failure investigation may 
also involve representatives of Occupational Health and Safety and other regulatory or law 
enforcement authorities. 
9.8 
Changes to Registered Designs and Pipeline Licence 
Changes to a registered design are handled by ABSA in accordance with section 22 of the PESR. 
ABSA does not allow an existing AER-approved pipeline to be converted from another service to a 
steam distribution service unless the pipeline was originally registered for those services. 
Amendments to the licensee’s AER pipeline licence are only required if the design changes lead to 
a change in the data recorded on the pipeline licence or in AER shapefiles.

Alberta Energy Regulator 
10 Comingling of Oil and Gas in a Single Pipeline 
10.1 Introduction 
Manual 014: Liquid Classification and Well Status Fluid Type Determination for Oil and Gas 
Wells provides classification criteria for wells. The properties of the liquids produced by a well 
determine whether it is condensate or oil, which determines whether the well is classified as oil 
or gas. 
Wells producing from a single reservoir usually have the same classification. However, sometimes 
a well within the group of wells will have a different classification even though its production 
characteristics are similar. Consequently, a pipeline gathering system could be licensed for a 
substance category different from the class of the outlier well. This situation would necessitate a 
separate pipeline to carry similar production from the same reservoir. In such cases, the AER would 
consider allowing commingling production in a single pipeline system. 
Commingling of fluids is only intended for cases where well classification results in wells being 
stranded in an area where the surrounding wells predominantly have a different well classification, 
but the production compositions of the stranded well are similar to the surrounding wells. 
10.2 Criteria for Pipeline Licensing of Commingled Production 
This process only applies to the commingling of oil effluent and natural gas. Commingling of oil 
effluent and natural gas where either one contains H2S is not permitted. 
88) The gas-oil ratio (GOR) must be measured at or converted to standard conditions. Depending 
on the calculated GOR of the commingled stream, the pipeline may need to be relicensed. 
89) Where oil effluent flows into a natural gas pipeline, and the resulting calculated GOR in the 
downstream line is ≤2000 m3/m3, the downstream line must be relicensed as an oil effluent 
pipeline. In this case, a licence amendment is required in accordance with Directive 056. 
Where oil effluent flows into a natural gas pipeline, the resulting calculated GOR in the 
downstream line must be >2000 m3/m3 for the downstream pipeline to remain licensed as a natural 
gas pipeline. 
Where natural gas flows into an oil effluent pipeline, the downstream oil effluent pipeline remains 
an oil effluent pipeline regardless of the gas content.

Appendix 2 Interpretation of Jurisdictional Relationships for the Design of Pipelines, 
Pressure Equipment, and Pressure Piping 
Background 
This appendix is a reference tool to assist licensees in understanding the relationships in design 
methodology and jurisdiction found in Alberta legislation and relevant industry standards used by 
the Alberta oil and gas industry: 
• American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) B31.3, Process Piping (2018 edition) 
• CSA standard CSA Z662: Oil and gas pipeline systems 
• Oil and Gas Conservation Act (OGCA) and Oil and Gas Conservation Rules (OGCR) 
• Pipeline Act and Pipeline Rules 
• Pressure Equipment Safety Regulation (PESR) and Pressure Equipment Exemption Order 
• Safety Codes Act (SCA) 
The reference tool provides information for pipelines, on-lease process piping and equipment, and 
pressure piping and equipment. 
The information provided in this reference tool does not apply to the regulatory jurisdiction for 
incident response and reporting, nor does it limit the scope of integrity management programs or 
liability for on-lease piping. 
The diagrams provided show typical design and jurisdictional relationships; how facility piping is 
configured or laid out can influence jurisdiction and is the design engineer’s responsibility. The 
variability of facility piping should be considered when determining design jurisdiction (and 
incident response and reporting requirements). The diagrams provided are examples and not 
intended as suggestions of how equipment should be configured nor represent the only way that 
jurisdiction may be designated. The general principles provided in this appendix apply to 
alternative layouts. 
The simplified example diagrams of well, pipeline, or facility piping configurations demonstrate the 
principles of design methodology and jurisdiction but do not supersede the requirements in the 
applicable acts, regulations, and standards. Although every effort has been made to ensure 
information accuracy, the user is responsible for ensuring the facility or pipeline complies with all 
requirements, regardless of the examples provided. 
This edition of the tool supersedes the one in the December 2011 edition of Directive 077 and is not 
intended to be applied retroactively. 
Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 31 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
The interpretations provided in this reference tool apply to all oil and gas pipelines in Alberta 
except the following: 
• a pipeline situated wholly within the property of a refinery, processing plant, coal processing 
plant, marketing plant, or manufacturing plant 
• a pipeline regulated by the Canada Energy Regulator 
• a gas or oil fuel pipe wholly within the property of a consumer 
• a boiler, pressure vessel, or pressure piping system within the meaning of the definitions under 
the SCA 
• low-pressure gas distribution pipelines 
Principles Used in Interpretation 
• This reference tool does not cover design and licensing requirements for a wellhead; refer to the 
OGCA. If a single valve is shown on the wellhead outlet, that valve is considered part of the 
wellhead as it isolates the wellhead. 
• Except in the case of a single valve on the wellhead outlet, the first valve inside the lease 
boundary is usually interpreted as the end of the Pipeline Act jurisdiction because this valve is 
the first isolation point for the pipeline. The entire valve is considered to be within the Pipeline 
Act jurisdiction. 
• A pig trap connected to a pipeline under the Pipeline Act jurisdiction is generally considered 
part of the licensed pipeline, including any connected piping and valving used to operate and 
isolate the pig traps and the piping isolation valve. When a pig trap is part of a pipeline, the first 
valve inside the lease boundary might not be considered the end of the Pipeline Act jurisdiction 
because all the pipeline up to and including the pig trap could be considered part of the licensed 
pipeline. Pig traps that are part of a pipeline under Pipeline Act jurisdiction are excluded from 
the Pressure Equipment Exemption Order under the SCA and therefore built in accordance with 
CSA Z662. 
• In situations where pipelines are not associated with a licensed facility, such as a pipeline 
pigging junction, it would be impractical to consider any connecting piping outside of the traps 
and isolation piping to be on-lease piping because all piping is functionally part of the 
pipelines. In such a case, treating all piping as part of a Pipeline Act pipeline system is 
reasonable. 
• Where multiple pipelines enter a common facility, the licensee may designate the jurisdictional 
break at the individual block valves (i.e., first isolation valve) on each pipeline if so equipped. 
Shared piping and pigging equipment inside the facility boundary and inside those pipeline 
32 Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
isolation valves could then be designated as under the OGCA jurisdiction. 
However, in doing so, any piping that might qualify as a “pressure piping system” as defined in 
the PESR is then subject to the SCA, and even though the facility may be under the jurisdiction 
of the OGCA, the SCA would apply to the pressure piping system and pigging equipment. The 
Pressure Equipment Exemption Order excludes pipelines under the Pipeline Act or OGCA. 
• CSA Z662 provides an option to allow ASME design for a pipeline within a compressor or 
pump station licensed as a pipeline installation (either a standalone licence or as part of a 
pipeline licence). The licensee must also comply with any requirements of CSA Z662 that are 
additional to those specified by ASME. 
• Jurisdiction does not change where the pipeline crosses a lease boundary. Pipelines entering or 
leaving a lease may travel some distance before reaching the first isolation valve or other 
facility piping, as the case may be. 
• It may be helpful in interpretation to consider that jurisdiction under the Pipeline Act ends with 
the last flange face that bolts to equipment under a different design jurisdiction. 
• On-lease piping designated under the OGCA does not have a design code specified and may be 
designed and built as either ASME B31.3 piping or CSA Z662 piping. 
• If the AER requests, licensees are expected to support their claims of jurisdictional assignment 
based on their engineering design drawings. 
Notes on Design and Licensing Requirements 
In general, pipelines and facility piping fall within three categories concerning their design 
requirements: pipeline, on-lease or facility piping, and pressure plant piping (under ABSA). 
Pipeline 
Includes pipelines entering or leaving a lease boundary (including its designated on-lease isolation 
valve), piping within a pipeline installation lease boundary, and general pig traps and their ancillary 
piping connected directly to a single pipeline. 
• Pipe and components under the jurisdiction of the AER and licensed under Directive 056: 
Energy Development Applications and Schedules must comply with the design requirements of 
CSA Z662. 
• The scope diagrams in clause 1 of CSA Z662 identify the types of facilities where CSA Z662 
design would and would not be required. However, CSA Z662 is an acceptable design standard 
for on-lease piping where the OGCA applies. 
• Apply CSA Z662 design requirements to Pipeline Act jurisdiction pig traps and the piping and 
valving used to operate the pig trap or to isolate the pig trap. 
Directive 077: Pipelines – Requirements and Reference Tools (November 2023) 33 
Alberta Energy Regulator 
On-Lease Piping 
Includes piping and components within an AER-licensed facility considered not part of a pipeline 
nor a “pressure plant” pressure piping system. 
• Piping and components included in a facility licensed under Directive 056or as a part of an 
unlicensed AER facility are under the jurisdiction of the OGCA and OGCR, which do not 
specify a design code or standard. Such piping may use either CSA Z662 or ASME B31.3 
design, provided that whichever standard is selected is used for all aspects of that piping. If the 
piping constitutes a pressure piping system, it falls under the jurisdiction of the SCA. 
• On-lease piping with pig traps may use either CSA Z662 or ASME B31.3 design standards, 
provided that piping is not interpreted as a pipeline and not interpreted as under SCA 
jurisdiction. 
• Piping crossing between adjacent and abutting facility surface leases can be considered on-lease 
piping. Leases must abut, and the piping cannot pass through any private or public lands 
between the leases. 
• Piping considered to be on-lease or facility piping 
− is not part of the SCA “pressure plant” pressure piping system; 
− is outside the scope of CSA Z662 as per the scope diagrams in clause 1 of CSA Z662, 
examples being production facilities and well sites; and 
− is not licensed as a pipeline. 
Pressure Piping 
Includes piping and components the SCA and PESR identify as part of a “pressure plant” pressure 
piping system. 
• “Pressure piping” is not under AER jurisdiction as per the Pipeline Act and Pipeline Rules and 
does not follow CSA Z662. 
• A “pressure plant” pressure piping system is within ABSA design jurisdiction and is 
administered by ABSA; it may exist within an AER-licensed facility or installation. 
• Pressure piping systems and their components are within ABSA design jurisdiction and are 
administered by ABSA under the SCA. A pressure piping system may exist within an AER
licensed facility or installation. 
• Both ABSA and the AER have roles respecting pipelines operating in steam or elevated
temperature services. ABSA conducts the technical design review and registration, and the 
AER licenses the pipeline.

Notes: 
1 All pipelines require an AER licence, including pipelines running between distinct mineral 
surface leases (MSLs) not considered to be within the same lease boundary (e.g., pipelines between 
steam-assisted gravity drainage [SAGD] well pads and the central processing facility are not 
considered as being on the same lease.) 
2 Production pipelines gather production (may be in liquid, vapour, or multiphase form and may 
include recovered steam) and are not in any other service. 
Steam distribution pipelines distribute steam from a steam-generating facility to steam-injection 
wells or well-pad facilities and are not in any other service. Multiservice pipelines are pipelines in 
steam distribution service or production service at various times. 
3 “Regular Z662” refers to conventional steel pipeline design using clauses 3 to 10 and 16 (if sour 
service) of CSA Z662: Oil and gas pipeline systems. 
4 “Z662 clause 14” refers to clause 14 (design) of CSA Z662 with other CSA Z662 clauses (3 to 10 
and 16) as applicable. 
5 “Z662 Annex I” refers to CSA Z662 Annex I design with clause 14 and other CSA Z662 clauses 
(3 to 10 and 16) as applicable. 
6 ABSA Directive IB10-006 requirements apply, including ABSA design registration. ABSA 
IB10-006 and ABSA registration only apply to pipelines with design pressure greater than 
103 kPa(g) and volume greater than 0.5 m3.
