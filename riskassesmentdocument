Executive Summary 
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is issuing this report to highlight 
the strengths and limitations for pipeline risk models, and to support improvements in Gas Transmission 
and Hazardous Liquid pipeline risk models.  Operators establish risk models to address risk and improve 
safety within their respective pipeline systems.  
Pipeline risk models are a foundational part of the assessment of operational pipeline risk.  Federal 
pipeline safety integrity management (IM) regulations require pipeline operators to use risk 
assessments.1  Based on the results of pipeline inspections and failure investigation findings, both the 
Department of Transportation’s PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have 
identified general weaknesses in the risk models used by pipeline operators in performing risk 
assessments for their IM programs.   
To help address this problem, PHMSA organized a Risk Modeling Work Group (RMWG) composed of 
representatives of state and federal pipeline regulators, pipeline operators, industry organizations, 
national laboratory personnel, and other stakeholders.  The purpose of the RMWG was to gather 
information regarding state-of-the-art pipeline risk modeling methods and tools, the use of those 
methods and tools, and the resulting data in operator IM programs.  This document provides an 
overview of methods and tools for improved implementation based on the results of the RMWG.2 
This report considers the major types of pipeline risk models, and the effectiveness of each type in 
supporting risk assessments, as applied to pipeline operator decisions.  The four major risk model types 
considered are: Qualitative, Relative Assessment/Index, Quantitative System, and Probabilistic.  Each 
type is characterized by the model inputs, outputs, and algorithms, and was evaluated according to its 
ability to support pipeline risk management decisions and regulatory requirements. 
This overview document focuses on the applicability of the different risk model types to various risk 
management decisions required by the Federal pipeline safety IM regulations, including: 
1. Risk Priorities for Baseline Integrity Assessments 
2. Identification of Preventive Measures and Mitigative Measures  
3. Evaluation and Comparison of Preventive Measures and Mitigative Measures  
4. Consideration of Threats and their Interactions in Risk Assessments 
5. Benefit-Cost Analysis for Risk Reduction Options3 
6. Integrity Assessment Interval Determination 
1 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 192, Subpart O (Gas Transmission Pipelines) and 49 CFR Part 195.452 
(Hazardous Liquid Pipelines).

PHMSA’s Pipeline Technical Resources web site in tab RMWG at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/pipeline/risk
modeling-work-group/risk-modeling-work-group-overview. 
3 The IM rules require operators to reduce risks to high consequence areas (HCAs) by implementing preventive 
and mitigative measures (risk reduction actions) beyond those measures specifically required elsewhere in the 
pipeline safety regulations (49 CFR Parts 192 and 195).  If limited operator resources require prioritization of 
measures that could be effective in reducing risk, then benefit-cost analysis, supported by the operator’s risk 
model, provides an effective method of promoting efficiency as well as risk reduction.

Making  
Conclusions 
This report details discussions and technical recommendations related to the various aspects of pipeline 
risk modeling.  PHMSA has derived the following summary conclusions: 
1. The overriding principle in employing any type of risk model/assessment is that it 
supports risk management decisions to reduce risks. 
2. While different risk model types have different capabilities for evaluating risk reduction 
actions, Quantitative System models or Probabilistic models are more versatile and 
provide greater capabilities to provide risk insights and support decision making.  Such 
models can be more complex; however, they do not necessarily require more data than 
other types of risk models. 
• Small pipeline operators with limited but highly knowledgeable personnel 
resources will likely continue to use Relative Assessment/Index models. 
• Pipeline operators who continue to use Relative Assessment/Index models 
should seek to supplement personnel judgment with as much physical data as 
can reasonably be acquired over time.   
• Adequate and accurate data is needed for the application of all risk model types. 
3. Pipeline operators should take ongoing actions to improve and update data quality and 
completeness over time.  However, the type of risk model to employ in pipeline risk 
analysis should not depend primarily on the perceived initial quality and completeness 
of input data because all of the models utilize the available data.  Instead, operators 
should select the best model approach and then populate the model with the best 
information currently available on risk factors or threats for each pipeline segment, and 
improve that data over time. 
4. It is important for risk models to include modeling of incorrect operations, which 
includes human interactions and human performance, that are significant to the 
likelihood of failure or have a significant effect on consequences of a failure (e.g., 
inappropriate controller restart of pumps, realistic emergency response time scenarios, 
design and construction human errors). 
5. It is important for pipeline risk models to include the potential effects of threats to 
interact in ways that can increase risk.  Therefore, when risk analysis involves multiple 
threats, the effect of “interactive threats” or dependencies on likelihood of failure 
should be clearly evaluated.

6. Varying levels of sophistication are possible in the analysis of the consequences of a 
failure.  However, it is important to consider an applicable range of scenarios (even if 
they do not have a high probability of occurrence) to capture the appropriate spectrum 
of possible consequences. 
7. The characteristics of pipeline facilities that affect risk may be significantly different than 
those of line pipe, but the same basic risk assessment principles apply, and the same 
types of models may be applied. 
PHMSA recommends that pipeline operators develop and apply risk models considering these summary 
conclusions and the associated technical recommendations contained in this document.  This should 
result in an improved understanding of the risks from pipeline systems and should improve critical 
safety information provided for the broader integrity and risk management processes. 
RMWG Meeting Technical Presentations 
The RMWG conducted several meetings during 2016 and 2017 to define, review, and document best 
practices in applying pipeline risk models.  The presentations on technical topics from the RMWG 
meetings have been used to develop this document.  Pipeline operators may wish to consider these 
presentations when developing their own risk models.  The below technical topics were presented at

Introduction 
Risk models are a foundational part of the assessment of operational pipeline risk and an 
integral part of gas and hazardous liquid pipeline integrity and risk management.  A risk model 
provides a representation of the risks throughout a pipeline system by combining inputs 
associated with both likelihood and consequence aspects of unintended pipeline releases.  The 
model supports risk analysis and helps operators evaluate and quantify the effects of various 
risk mitigation activities and make risk management decisions.   
This document provides an overview of methods and tools to be used in risk modeling in 
support of pipeline integrity and risk management of gas and hazardous liquid transmission 
pipelines.  Broader topics such as integrity management systems, quality management systems, 
overall risk management, and safety management systems are not addressed within this 
document.   
Federal gas and hazardous liquid pipeline safety integrity management (IM) regulations (see 
Appendix E) contain requirements for the uses of risk assessments by pipeline operators.  Based 
on the results of pipeline inspections and failure investigation findings, both the U.S. 
Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration 
(PHMSA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have identified general 
weaknesses in the risk models used by pipeline operators in performing risk assessments for 
their IM programs.  Generally, the models used have not enabled operators to systematically 
identify and effectively analyze risk reduction actions.  PHMSA has previously communicated 
findings and concerns regarding risk models at past public meetings.4 
In 2015, the NTSB published a safety study titled Integrity Management of Gas Transmission 
Pipelines in High Consequence Areas (https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety
studies/Pages/SS1501.aspx).  The NTSB undertook this study because of concerns about 
deficiencies in the operators’ integrity management programs and the oversight of these 
programs by PHMSA and state regulators.  As a result of the study, the NTSB made three 
recommendations to PHMSA concerning the use of risk assessments: 
• Recommendation P-15-10: Update guidance for gas transmission pipeline 
operators and inspectors on the evaluation of interactive threats.  This guidance 
4 See meeting records for “Improving Pipeline Risk Assessments and Recordkeeping,” Arlington, Virginia, July 21, 
2011 (https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/meetings/MtgHome.mtg?mtg=70), and “PHMSA Pipeline Risk Modeling 
Methodologies Public Workshop,” Arlington, Virginia, September 9, 2015,

methods to be used.

Important Elements of Likelihood Modeling, Part E, Interactive Threat 
Modeling.  The section lists different threats that can potentially 
interact as well as methods for incorporating threat interactions into 
risk models and provides discussions of the completed PHMSA-funded 
project DTPH56-14-H-00004 that provides tools and techniques for 
accounting for interacting threats in risk assessments

To promote the development and application of improved pipeline risk models and to respond 
to these recommendations, PHMSA committed to organize and work with stakeholders in a Risk 
Modeling Work Group (RMWG) to help inform the development of this overview of methods 
and tools document.   
The RMWG6 was organized with representatives from state and federal pipeline regulators, 
pipeline operators and industry organizations, national laboratories, and other stakeholders.

RMWG mission statement.

This overview document incorporates information gathered from the presentations, meetings, 
and comments from members of the RMWG with respect to the state-of-the-art of pipeline risk 
modeling. 
Risk is defined7 as a measure of potential loss in terms of both the likelihood (or frequency of 
occurrence) of an event and the magnitude of the consequences from the event.  A standard 
conceptual definition of risk used to structure risk assessment is given by the equation: 
�
�𝑖𝑠𝑘 = 𝐿𝑖𝑘𝑒𝑙𝑖ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑑 𝑥 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 
For hazardous liquid and natural gas pipeline systems, the basic undesired event is the failure of 
a pipeline or pipeline system that results in a release of the gas or hazardous liquid.  Likelihood 
is the probability or frequency of failure due to threats that affect the pipeline, and 
consequence is the severity of impacts to different receptor categories (e.g., human safety, 
environment, property) because of a pipeline failure. 
A risk analysis considers the likelihood of failure from all potential and existing threats at each 
location along the pipeline.  In addition, each receptor category may experience different 
consequence levels from a pipeline failure, depending on the failure mode (e.g., leak vs. rupture 
event) and location of the failure (e.g., proximity to receptors such as population and 
environmentally sensitive areas).   
Federal pipeline safety regulations have included requirements for risk assessment and risk 
analysis in the hazardous liquid and gas pipeline integrity management (IM) rules since their 
inception.  Gas transmission IM requirements are found in 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 
Part 192, Subpart O.  Hazardous Liquid IM requirements are found in 49 CFR Part 195.452.8  
Initially, many pipeline operators implemented relative risk models to prioritize their 
performance of baseline integrity assessments and remediation of pipeline segment threats.  
However, the application of risk analysis required by Federal pipeline safety regulations goes 
well beyond the simple prioritization of pipeline segments for baseline integrity assessments.  
Additional applications include the following broad areas of performance requirements: 
• Identification (§§ 195.452 (i)(1) and 192.935(a)) and evaluation (§§ 195.452 
(i)(2), 192.911(c), and 192.917(c)) of preventive measures and mitigative 
measures; 
7 See definitions used in Section I of this document. 
8 See Appendix E of this document for excerpts from these requirements that relate to risk assessment and risk 
models.  Regulatory references are those in effect as of the date of this document.

• Continual integrity evaluation process to identify the risks of integrity threats 
(§§ 195.452 (j)(2) and 192.937(b)); and 
• Continual integrity assessment interval determination process ((§§ 195.452 
(j)(3) and 192.939(a)(1)(i)). 
PHMSA inspections of operator IM programs include operator risk assessment processes and 
the risk models employed in those processes; inspection experience indicates that operators’ 
risk assessment approaches, primarily qualitative and relative risk models, have been lacking in 
many cases to meet all IM requirements and provide meaningful insight into the risks in an 
operator’s unique operating environment. 
The IM regulations also require operators to continuously improve their IM programs, and 
overall industry integrity performance has shown general improvement over time.  However, 
the continuing occurrence of significant pipeline incidents points to a continuing need for 
operators to upgrade their tools for risk assessment and risk management.  Upgrades to risk 
assessment processes using quantitative or probabilistic risk models is a prudent step for 
operators to take to improve IM programs, allowing better definition of the risks on pipeline 
systems and better support for risk management practices.   
PHMSA has communicated its findings and concerns regarding risk models at past public 
meetings9 and worked with the stakeholder participants in the RMWG to develop this overview 
document in support of improved pipeline risk models and their usage, as appropriate. 
Risk models employed in pipeline risk analysis can be categorized based on the nature of the 
model’s inputs, outputs, and the nature of the algorithms used to convert the inputs to outputs.  
This overview document evaluates each category for its suitability to support pipeline operator 
decision making. 
Table II-1 below gives the breakdown of risk model categories:

The Qualitative model uses qualitative inputs and outputs.  The model translates any 
quantitative inputs into ranges or qualitative outputs (e.g., high, medium, low).  The algorithm in 
this model is a direct mapping of inputs to outputs, often represented by a matrix.12 
The Relative Assessment or Index model uses quantitative or qualitative inputs to derive 
quantitative outputs using a scoring algorithm.13  Scores assigned to inputs are combined to 
obtain a unit-less quantitative output “index” score.  The most common method of combining 
inputs and obtaining model outputs is to sum the individual and sometimes weighted risk factor 
scores.   
The quantitative outputs are not expressed in risk assessment units like probability, frequency, 
or expected loss.  Instead, they are unit-less index scores for likelihood, consequence, and risk.  
This method of combining risk factor inputs and producing outputs distinguishes this model 
from quantitative system or probabilistic models.  Index models were used widely by pipeline 
operators to establish priorities for integrity assessments as part of the baseline integrity 
assessment requirements of the pipeline IM rules.

• The term “semi-quantitative” risk model is not used in this document, in part due to 
RMWG technical discussions that indicated a wide variance in how this term can be 
interpreted.  ASME B31.8S also does not use the term semi-quantitative, but in the 
description of the relative assessment model approach states “Such relative or data
based methods use models that identify and quantitatively weigh the major threats and 
consequences relevant to past pipeline operations. These approaches are considered 
relative risk models, since the risk results are compared with results generated from the 
same model.”  Consistent with this treatment, risk models that have incorporated 
quantitative elements into their algorithms, but retain the underlying relative model 
structure, are included in the Table II-1 “Relative Assessment/Index” model category. 
The Quantitative System model also has quantitative inputs and outputs.  However, it is 
distinguished from Relative Assessment/Index models in significant ways, including: 
• Use of quantitative inputs and outputs that are expressed in risk assessment 
units like probability, frequency, expected loss, etc.  Usage of risk assessment 
units is an important distinction from numerical/quantitative values used in 
Relative Assessment/Index models that are unit-less values, and only can be 
used to compare if they are higher/lower than other values within the model.  
For example:14 
o In a Relative/Index Model, a threat input value of “8” for coating 
condition on one pipeline segment versus a value of “4” on a different 
segment does not mean it is twice as likely to cause a failure due to 
poor coating, only that the segment with the higher value has relatively 
poorer coating than the segment with the lower value. 
o In a Relative/Index Model, a risk output value of “70” for a pipeline 
segment does not represent “twice” the risk of a different segment with 
an output value of “35”; only that the segment with the higher value 
has been determined to be of higher risk relative to the segment that 
has a lower score. 
• Algorithms that model the physical and logical relationships of the pipeline 
system risk factors, the threats to system integrity, and the potential 
consequences of a product release from the system.  This approach aims to 
combine risk factors in ways that more directly reflect physical reality (e.g., 
corrosion rates applied to effective wall thicknesses).  The outputs from these 
models are likelihood, consequence, and risk measures expressed in 
recognizable units, such as probability or frequency of failure and expected loss.   
A minority of operators have employed models of this type in their IM 
programs. 
14 In these examples, higher values imply higher threat likelihood and higher risk.

As a simplified example of how Quantitative System models might model the relationship of risk 
factors in a pipeline system, consider part of a model of the probability of failure from third
party excavation damage.  A failure from excavation damage may be modeled as the logical 
combination of factors such as the frequency of excavation activity in the area of the pipeline, 
one-call system probabilities, depth of cover, probability of an excavator hitting the pipeline, 
pipe resistance to a hit, and the effect of pipeline rights-of-way (ROW) patrolling.  Figure II-1 
(also shown in Appendix A.3) is an illustration of such a model for developing the probability of a 
pipeline hit by an excavator, using a fault tree to model the relationship of the relevant risk 
factors.15  In this model, the probability of a hit is calculated by evaluating the likelihood of the 
individual risk factors (frequency of construction activity, probability of inadequate cover, 
probability of inadequate one-call, etc.) and combining these likelihoods according to the logical 
relationships in the model.  The model’s output likelihood is calculated in the units of frequency 
(per unit time) of a pipeline hit.16 
Figure II-1 
Simplified Example Fault Tree Model for Excavator to Hit Pipeline17 
The Probabilistic model is a specific type of Quantitative System model.  It is distinguished from 
other such models by using probability distributions to represent uncertainties in model inputs.  
Input distributions are propagated through the model to obtain probability distributions that 
represent uncertainty in the model outputs, such as failure probability, severity of consequences 
given a failure, or expected loss. 
15  See ISO/IEC 31010:2009 – Risk management – Risk assessment techniques, Annex B.14.  
16  In contrast, an index model would have unit-less output values based on the (possibly weighted) sum of the 
individual risk factor scores.

E.1 ASME B31.8S Risk Assessment Method Categorization 
In choosing risk assessment approaches to evaluate, PHMSA chose the risk model categories 
listed in above Table II-1, Risk Model Categories, as they are applicable for both hazardous liquid 
pipelines and gas transmission pipelines and represented basic methods of modeling. 
ASME B31.8S-200418 presented four alternative approaches for gas transmission integrity 
management risk assessment: 
1. Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) 
2. Relative Assessment Models 
3. Scenario-Based Models 
4. Probabilistic Models 
While there is overlap between these and PHMSA’s four categories, the RMWG members noted 
that the ASME categories were not strictly risk models, but instead a mixture of both risk 
assessment tools and models.19  
For example, Subject Matter Experts perform an important role in all types of pipeline risk 
modeling, and SME input is fundamental to both qualitative and quantitative model input.  As a 
risk assessment method, the Table II-1 “Qualitative” category is comparable to the “Subject 
Matter Experts” B31.8S risk assessment approach category.  To minimize potential confusion 
with the more general role of SMEs for all types of pipeline risk models, the term “Qualitative” 
risk model is used in this document instead of “Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).” 
The RMWG members also noted that stand-alone scenario-based methods were utilized by 
some (mainly hazardous liquid) pipeline operators in the early phases of integrity management 
program development.  These approaches look at specific failures and seek to identify events 
that could lead to that failure (e.g., HAZOP is a type of scenario model).  In practice, this 
approach has proved to be difficult to apply to significant lengths of line pipe, and more recent 
applications have generally been limited to specialized cases (e.g., where a particular 
consequence is of concern).20 
In addition, the B31.8S description of the “Scenario-Based” risk assessment method notes that 
“This method usually includes construction of event trees, decision trees, and fault trees.” As 
noted previously in this section, these types of tools are often employed in both quantitative 
and probabilistic risk models as part of their model algorithms.  For instance, fault trees21 may 
be used to break down failure due to threats into more specific constituent events that can lead

to failure.  Figure II-1 shows an example fault tree approach for excavation damage using a 
logical combination of contributing factors.  The system can be modeled to the level of 
specificity where data and SME input can be applied to quantify the failure probability or 
frequency.  Given that the application of this document is for both hazardous liquid pipelines 
and gas transmission pipelines, and that scenario-based tools can be used for various types of 
risk models, use of scenario-based tools were folded into the quantitative system and 
probabilistic risk model categories of this document.

Overview Information for Use of Risk Model Types 
Pipeline operators should select risk models capable of supporting risk management decisions 
required as part of pipeline IM programs as well as more general risk management decisions 
that may be required.  Table III-1 characterizes and compares the suitability of the different risk

Qualitative Models and Relative/Index Models (Model Category A and Category B) 
The initial application of risk models required by the hazardous liquid and gas transmission IM 
rules was to establish risk-based priorities for baseline integrity assessments.  Relative 
assessment/index models, and to some extent qualitative-oriented models, were widely used by 
pipeline operators to support this requirement.  This allowed large numbers of pipeline 
segments to be ranked based on risk factors.  As indicated in Table III-1, the relative nature of 
assessment prioritization is an applicable application of these models.  In the event a situation 
arises that would require the prioritization of a several new pipeline segments for a baseline 
assessment, relative/index models would still be applicable. 
In addition to the broad scope of pipeline accident likelihood and consequence factors 
considered when using these type of risk models, Qualitative and Relative Assessment/Index 
models may be applied to support identification of preventive and mitigative measures, by 
considering model inputs and measures that change these inputs to values that are estimated to 
reduce risk.  This application is essentially qualitative in nature, indicating the general effect 
proposed measures on the risk, so is appropriate for identifying P&M measures. 
In general, application of Qualitative and Relative/Index models is more challenging for 
applications where the degree of difference between different scenarios, options, etc., or the 
risk as compared to a quantitative risk criterion is important, in addition to simply knowing 
which is a relatively higher or lower risk.  Outputs from Qualitative and Relative 
Assessment/Index models may not be based on consistent units and cannot be assumed to be 
proportional to outputs like failure frequency, probability, or expected loss. 
Qualitative or Relative Assessment/Index models do not produce this kind of output directly, so 
additional analysis or evaluation of the results is needed when these models are used to support 
comparison of alternative preventive or mitigative measures or benefit-cost analysis.  Results 
from both Qualitative and Relative Assessment/Index models should be supplemented with 
additional analysis or data processing to be effective in supporting risk decisions. 
Risk models that produce consistent quantitative output in standard risk units (probability of 
failure, expected loss, etc.) provide an easier format for evaluating and comparing risk 
alternatives, particularly for larger multi-regional pipeline systems.  For applications, such as the 
comparison of alternative preventive or mitigative measures, or benefit-cost analysis, some 
form of a quantitative type of risk model output in standard risk units is generally needed. 
In practice, continued use of qualitative and relative assessment/index models is best suited for 
small, less complex pipeline systems, where the effects of preventive and mitigative measures 
25 
February 1, 2020 
February 1, 2020  
on risk can be reasonably be understood via changes to the model inputs.22  These systems can 
be characterized by limited geographic extent and lower mileage; simple system configuration; 
uniform risk factors throughout the system; affected HCAs limited in extent and similar in 
nature; and single, small operating organization. 
Operators planning to continue the use of Qualitative and Relative Assessment/Index models 
should seek to supplement personnel judgment with as much pipeline physical attribute data as 
can reasonably be acquired over time.  Operators should also ensure their risk model is capable 
of supporting risk management decisions required as part of pipeline IM programs, such as the 
selection of preventive and mitigative measures, and can be utilized for threat identification, risk 
analysis, and general risk management decisions. 
Quantitative System Models (Model Category C) 
Quantitative System models can be applicable for all decision types.  The algorithms and outputs 
of quantitative system models produce quantitative estimates of overall risk, using consistent 
units.  These models can be used to estimate the risk before and after risk reduction measures 
are implemented.  Because a quantitative system model represents the physical and logical 
relationships of model inputs, the inputs can be varied to define alternatives and compare the 
risk reduction effects of each alternative.  Candidate risk reduction measures at different 
locations along the pipeline can be compared via quantitative estimates using consistent input 
units.  Quantified risk reduction benefits can be combined with data on implementation costs to 
perform benefit-cost analysis to further enhance decision making. 
Probabilistic Models (Model Category D) 
Probabilistic models are considered a best practice for supporting all decision types.  
Probabilistic models have the added feature of representing the uncertainty (i.e., realism) in 
model inputs by probability distributions, and the resulting ability to produce distributions for 
model outputs.  This allows a systematic representation of uncertainty and unique risk insights 
for decision making not allowed by other model types.  When utilizing the same data as a 
Relative model, the probability distribution outputs from the Probabilistic model inform the 
operator on the range of possible outcomes, regardless of data quality, which allows for more 
consistent decision making.   
An example of the application of both Quantitative System and Probabilistic models is the 
incorporation of integrity assessment results and associated defect findings and remediation.  In 
these models, the probability of failure and overall risk can be estimated using different integrity 
assessment intervals.  Results can then be used to define optimal integrity assessment intervals 
consistent with the operator’s risk tolerance.  A Probabilistic model with input and output 
distributions is particularly effective for identifying integrity assessment intervals through its 
22  See ISO/IEC 31010:2009 – Risk management – Risk assessment techniques, Annex B, Section B.28, for additional 
discussion on the strengths and limitations of risk index models. 
26

ability to support evaluation of the uncertainty in the predicted probability of failure given 
actual integrity assessment results.  Also, uncertainties due to tool tolerances and other risk 
model inputs, such as corrosion growth rates, excavation damage statistics, and equipment 
reliability can be represented by input probability distributions, which may be propagated 
through the risk model along with other inputs to give an output distribution for probability of 
failure that more accurately portrays risk. 
It should be noted that the IM rules require operators to reduce risks to high consequence areas 
(HCAs) by implementing preventive and mitigative measures beyond those measures required 
elsewhere in Parts 192 and 195 of the pipeline safety regulations.  If limited operator resources 
require prioritization of risk reduction measures, then benefit-cost analysis, supported by the 
application of an effective risk model, can optimize the prioritization results.  [Note: Risk analysis 
results should not be used to defer/delay the normal process of pipeline system remediation of 
known deficient conditions.] 
A.1 Moving from Qualitative or Relative Assessment/Index Models to Quantitative 
System or Probabilistic Models  
Quantitative System and Probabilistic models are considered more robust and capable of 
supporting all risk reduction decisions.  Operators should consider moving to these risk 
modeling categories, as appropriate. 
Developing and implementing Quantitative System models does not necessarily require more 
resources than Relative Assessment/Index models, despite some perceptions to the contrary.  
The structure of Quantitative System models can be more complex; however, they do not 
necessarily require more data than Index models and may be developed and implemented with 
common tools such as Microsoft Excel. 
Many Relative Assessment/Index and Qualitative risk models include relatively large numbers of 
inputs representing pipeline characteristics and other risk factors.  These inputs can serve as a 
starting point for development of a Quantitative System model that provides failure probability 
and risk in standard units.  The inputs for Relative Assessment/Index models are often already 
quantified and can readily be incorporated in a Quantitative System model.  PHMSA believes 
that operators using Relative Assessment/Index models should consider taking steps to develop 
Quantitative System models that utilize the inputs from their existing models.  This would 
enhance the risk reduction decision making ability for those operators. 
Probabilistic models are sometimes perceived as being excessively complex and requiring 
significant additional data.  While it is true that quantifying a Probabilistic model involves more 
than a basic “spreadsheet” type of calculation, applying probabilistic analysis to basic 
Quantitative System models can be a more powerful use of available data.  And while 
Probabilistic models are frequently believed to require more data, effective Probabilistic models 
can be developed with the same data used in Relative risk models.  Effective Probabilistic model 
development is dependent upon appropriate use of data to accurately represent both the 
27

certainty the data provides and the uncertainty the data implies.  Modeling uncertainty in a 
Probabilistic model better informs the operator regarding the spectrums of the consequence 
and likelihood of failure that are possible, which, in turn, allows the operator to identify more 
effective risk reduction actions and improves assessment tool selection. 
Probabilistic models include a more accurate representation of uncertainties than those 
provided by a Relative Assessment/Index risk model that uses point estimates of the same data 
as inputs.  
A pragmatic approach is to evolve from the use of Relative Assessment/Index risk models to 
Quantitative or Probabilistic models over time.  Organizational experience in developing and 
implementing quantitative system models for a limited number of threats can then be applied in 
a way that maximizes the benefits and optimizes the level of resources needed as the 
quantitative system model and probabilistic approaches are applied to an increasing number of 
threats.23  Appendix D outlines one process for evolving Relative Index models to more of a 
Quantitative System modeling approach. 
The output of any risk model is an estimation of actual risk, so it is important to consider how 
much uncertainty may be involved with the model outputs.  Variations in risk model inputs 
impact results, and different parameters have different influences on the results. 
For Quantitative System models, input parameters can be represented by ranges of possible 
values, and the effect on the output of varying each input can be calculated.  For Probabilistic 
models, the uncertainty in model inputs can be represented by probability distributions.   
It is important to review the impact of input uncertainty to identify which uncertainties should 
be reduced by obtaining additional information.  For example, the operator’s SMEs may assign 
input variables a wide range of values given a lack of data or lack of SME agreement.  If the 
range has a significant impact on the risk model results, efforts to obtain better data to reduce 
that uncertainty may be appropriate, particularly if the additional information could improve the 
evaluation of alternative risk reduction measures.  In a probabilistic model, important model 
inputs (distributions) can be directly reviewed to help identify where there is significant 
uncertainty in the inputs (which ultimately impacts the confidence of model results).  These 
inputs can be targeted for updating to reduce uncertainty and improve the fidelity of model 
results.  [Appendix A Figure A-3 provides example distributions that represent uncertainties for 
model inputs as an illustration of this approach.] 
Inputs that have the biggest impact on risk model output results are sometimes referred to as 
the “risk drivers.”  It is important when reviewing the risk drivers for a segment of line pipe or a 
23  Section IV.C addresses the potential for employing threat-specific risk models instead of a single modeling 
approach for all threats. 
28 
February 1, 2020

pipeline facility to determine if the model output results make basic technical sense.  Examples 
are: risk model results are as expected by SMEs, no errors in the risk model or the inputs, or 
SME expectations are incorrect.  (See Section III.C, Model Validation.) 
Investigation of risk drivers can also suggest preventive and/or mitigative measures, by 
indicating the factors that could lead to the greatest reduction in risk if changed.  Risk models 
should include the risk factors that change because of preventive measures and mitigative 
measures.  If evaluated risk reduction measures do not result in differences in the model 
outputs, then analysts should ensure that this is not merely because the model does not include 
the applicable risk factors.   
The relative importance of risk factors depends on the particular risk model output(s) of 
interest.  Inputs may be important risk drivers over specific pipeline segments, but not 
significant system-wide or operator-wide.  For example, the risk of failure due to a landslide 
might be negligible for the large majority of pipeline segments but could be the single most 
important risk factor for some segments with certain topography and soil conditions.  The risk 
assessment model should accurately account for segment-specific parameters that are critical to 
the segment of pipeline being evaluated that experience similar threats and consequences. 
Risk model development requires the review of risk assessment results and validation of the 
model input and output data, both periodically and whenever significant changes are made to 
the model or its inputs (e.g., if operational experience demonstrates that data needs to be 
revised).  Figure III-2 depicts typical risk model validation steps to ensure quality and the most 
accurate representation of pipeline risk. 
Figure III-2 
Model Validation 
Validation of model inputs typically includes: 
1. Model inputs should be validated against existing data/operational history and SME 
estimates, including inputs to both the likelihood and consequence analyses. 
2. Model inputs need to represent the most accurate available information on each 
pipeline location.  To accomplish this, input data should be reviewed and updated, as 
appropriate, by trained and qualified personnel.  Management of risk model input 
29 
February 1, 2020 
February 1, 2020  
datasets should include clearly defined requirements, definitions, process owners, 
process maps, and governance structures to ensure compliance with ANSI/ASME 
B31.8S-2004 Section 5.7b.  This clear definition of roles and responsibilities also 
applies if portions of the work are contracted to external organizations. 
3. Consequence variables such as failure mode, response times, conditions affecting 
dispersion, and the locations of receptors need to cover the range of possibilities to 
ensure a representative selection of outcomes, particularly so that high-consequence 
outcomes are identified and can be selected for the application of risk reduction 
activities. 
4. The structure of the risk model and algorithm(s) used to calculate risk measures 
should be checked to ensure the relationships of risk inputs are appropriately 
represented.  The structure, analytical functions, analytical content, and technical 
computing structure detailed within the model should be continually reviewed and 
updated, as appropriate, by applicably trained and qualified personal.   
Validation of model outputs typically includes: 
1. Model outputs should be validated against SME review.  The review includes 
operator-specific knowledge to ensure results are appropriate for operator-specific 
risks.  The highest frequency sources of risk predicted by the model and risk drivers 
should be consistent with applicable historical data.   
2. The results should be consistent with failure history data.  If operating history of the 
analyzed pipeline or similar pipelines include failures or consequences that are not 
captured by the model, then changes to the model should be considered to include 
factors related to such historical events. 
3. If model results vary sharply from SME expectations or operating history, the model 
and input values involved should be examined to identify the source(s) of the 
variance.  It is possible that the discrepancy points to a need for data correction or 
modification to the model to accurately represent risk.  It is also possible that the risk 
model results will yield new insights that are not consistent with SME expectations, 
so there may be variance in the operator’s understanding of risk-important 
characteristics and what is produced by the model.  These new insights into risk 
drivers are a valuable benefit of a risk model. 
Risk models are no different than other analytical tools supporting safe pipeline operation.  They 
should be reviewed and updated on a regular, defined basis to assure they continue to 
accurately reflect the pipeline system’s configuration and operation.  A structured management 
of change process also applies to pipeline risk models.  For example, data about the pipeline 
system is constantly being acquired, and updates to risk model inputs should be performed 
routinely to incorporate the latest information. 
30 
February 1, 2020 
February 1, 2020  
While the details of achieving management of change will vary for differing aspects of a risk 
model, the process for control and update of the model should assure that risk estimates 
provided to decision makers are accurate and incorporate the latest system information.  For 
example, information on the population near the pipeline may change less frequently than 
cathodic protection information and may need less frequent updating in the model. 
• The overriding principle in employing any type of model to support risk assessment is that it be 
capable of supporting risk management decisions.   
o A quantitative system or probabilistic model utilizes many of the same inputs as a 
relative assessment/index model.  However, quantitative system and probabilistic 
models have algorithms that represent the physical relationships of model inputs, and 
model outputs that are risk measures in standard units.  Consequently, the outputs from 
quantitative system models or probabilistic models are directly applicable to support 
evaluation and comparison of preventive measures.  In general, a quantitative system or 
probabilistic model is more versatile for such an evaluation, with greater capabilities to 
provide risk insights and support decision making. 
o Outputs for qualitative and relative assessment/index models are not risk measures in 
standard units that are easily comparable for different segments or different preventive 
measures.  Therefore, additional processing and interpretation of the results may be 
required to apply model risk evaluations to decision making by the operator.  This 
additional processing and interpretation necessarily takes place outside of the risk 
model as part of the operator’s overall risk assessment and risk evaluation process. 
• Identification and evaluation of preventive measures is an important application of risk 
assessment, and required by IM regulations.  This application can be supported by a risk model 
that has the following characteristics: 
o The model can indicate the change in risk from implementation of the risk reduction 
measure.   
o The model includes all threats to the pipeline segment that can be addressed by 
preventive measures. 
o Model inputs represent the pipeline characteristics and other risk factors affected by 
the preventive measures, so that the effect of each measure can be evaluated through 
changes in inputs or changes to the structure of the model.

IV. 
Likelihood Modeling for Line Pipe 
This section24 on line pipe covers important characteristics of the likelihood part of the risk 
definition and formula.25 Likelihood represents the chance of an unwanted event occurring.  In 
the context of pipeline risk modeling, the primary “unwanted event” for hazardous liquid and 
natural gas pipelines is the failure of a pipeline or pipeline system to contain the gas or 
hazardous liquid product.  The likelihood part of a pipeline risk model encompasses the 
scenarios for failure and uses the model input variables in those scenarios and the 
interrelationships among inputs to estimate an overall likelihood of failure.  To accomplish this, 
the model should specify: 
1. Input variables representing characteristics of a pipeline segment and the environment 
around the segment, representing all factors important for estimating the likelihood of 
failure for the segment: They represent the prevalence of threats, the resistance of the 
pipeline system to threats, and the effectiveness of existing preventive measures.  These 
variables may include pipe condition, coating condition, cathodic protection (CP) 
effectiveness, operating pressure, operating stress level, depth of cover, excavation 
activity around the pipeline, landslide potential, and product transported.   
2. How to combine the model inputs in the overall evaluation of the likelihood of failure.  
The model should accurately represent threat interactions that could increase the 
likelihood of failure, and specify whether an input variable can cause failure on its own 
or must occur in combination with other factors.   
Different model types have different output likelihood measures.  Output likelihood measures 
from different model types26 can be qualitative categories, relative indexes, or quantitative 
measures of probability or frequency in standard units.  Output measures in standard units, such 
as failures per unit distance per unit time (e.g., failures per mile per year) are the most flexible 
and widely applicable model outputs, allowing a consistent measure of failure likelihood for a 
pipeline segment, specifying time and distance (length): 
1. The likelihood of failure varies depending on the time interval being considered.  For 
example, the likelihood of failure for a specific pipeline segment is higher over a 10
year period than during a single year.  Consequently, likelihood measures are 
typically expressed as frequencies per unit time (e.g., failures per year). 
2. The likelihood of failure also varies depending on which portion of a pipeline system 
is being evaluated.  As a system that can extend over long linear distances, a 
pipeline has different likelihoods of failure for different portions, because risk 
24  Sections IV and V of this document consider modeling of likelihood and consequences primarily for line pipe 
segments.  Risk modeling for pipeline facilities (e.g., pump and compressor stations, tank facilities) is considered 
in Section VII. 
25  See Section II.C of this document for definitions and formula. 
26  See Section II.D of this document. 
32 
February 1, 2020

factors vary at different locations.  A pipeline risk model should be able to evaluate 
the likelihood of failure for specifically defined segments. 
Sections IV.A through IV.H below provide additional information on risk model treatment of 
likelihood. 
The likelihood of pipeline failure is derived from the collective likelihood of all threats acting on 
the pipeline and leading to pipeline failure.  Pipeline risk models break down broad threat 
categories into more specific inputs that can be quantified using data or judgment and 
combined by a model algorithm to obtain the likelihood estimate. 
Pipeline IM regulations (see Appendix E) require identification and evaluation of preventive 
measures to reduce the likelihood of failure.  Most preventive measures implemented by 
pipeline operators attempt to reduce the likelihood of failure due to a single threat or a subset 
of threats.  To evaluate these potential preventive measures, the operator determines the 
impact of the potential measure on the likelihood of failure for each threat (also accounting for 
interacting or dependent threats) and sums all the threats to identify the final impact of the 
potential change to the likelihood of failure. 
Historical pipeline failure experience has resulted in a generally consistent scheme for 
categorizing threats.  Different sources employ similar categorization of threats that should be 
considered for a complete evaluation of pipeline failure likelihood.  The Risk Modeling Work 
Group considered the threat categorization from four sources: 
a. ASME Standard B31.8S-2004 identified threats27 
b. Muhlbauer identified failure causes 28  
c. Canadian incident reporting failure causes29 
d. U.S. DOT accident and incident report causes30 
PHMSA compared and integrated the categories from these four sources to develop the 
following categories of threats recommended for the likelihood portion of risk models: 
1. External Corrosion 
2. Internal Corrosion 
3. Environmental Cracking (including SCC) 
4. Structural/Material Degradation (non-steel pipe) 
27  ASME B31.8S-2004, Managing System Integrity of Gas Pipelines, 2005.  Although developed specifically for 
application to gas pipelines, the threat categories in this document are applicable to hazardous liquid pipelines.

5. Manufacturing-related Defects (includes defective pipe and seam acted on by 
fatigue or other failure mechanisms) 
6. Construction-, Installation-, or Fabrication-related Defects (includes defective girth 
weld, fabrication weld, wrinkle bend or buckle, stripped threads, broken pipe, 
coupling failure acted on by fatigue or other failure mechanisms) 
7. Equipment Failure (includes failure of control/relief equipment, pump, compressor, 
seal/pump packing failure, threaded or non-threaded connection, tubing or fitting, 
gasket O-ring, equipment body) 
8. Excavation Damage (includes damage by operator, contractor, or third party; 
includes immediate failure or damage that results in later failure) 
9. Other Accidental Outside Force Damage (includes causes such as vehicle impacts, 
other fire or explosion, electric arcing) 
10. Intentional Damage/Vandalism/Sabotage 
11. Incorrect/Improper Operation (includes human errors such as tank overfull, valve 
misalignment, over-pressurization, improper equipment installation) 
12. Geohazards/Weather/Natural Force Damage 
13. Other/Uncategorized/Emerging Threat 
Models should include all applicable threats, including any emerging threats found by pipeline 
operators that do not fit easily into the categories listed above.  Even threats that have a low 
likelihood of causing a pipeline failure at a given location should be considered in the model 
(e.g., if the potential consequences due a failure from a low likelihood threat at the location 
could be high, the overall risk might be significant). 
The development of algorithms for assessing likelihood using a quantitative system model can 
employ a variety of approaches.  The overall likelihood of failure is built threat by threat, by 
considering the factors affecting the likelihood of failure for each threat.31 The structure and 
approach to estimating the likelihood of failure due to different threats can vary widely in 
Quantitative System models.  The choice of approach may also differ for different threats within 
the same model, based on the available data and information.  Some different likelihood 
modeling approaches include:32 
1. SME opinion – SME opinion is converted into quantitative probabilities.   
2. Historical data – Historical failure rates from available databases are used to 
estimate baseline failure rates, which are modified to reflect system specific 
attributes. 
31  Including accounting for threat interactions; see Section IV.E of this document. 
32  This list of approaches is taken from Skow, J., C-FER Technologies, Inc., Critical Review of Candidate Pipeline Risk 
Models, presentation at Pipeline Risk Modeling Methodologies Public Workshop, September 2015.  See also

3. Reliability Analysis Methods – Detailed engineering models are used to estimate 
probability and consequence.   
Another method for assessing the likelihood of failure for different threats is the “triad” 
approach recommended by Muhlbauer.33  This approach envisions the modeling of pipeline 
failure mechanisms as assessing “exposure,” “mitigation,” and “resistance,” defined as: 
“…Exposure (attack) -…defined as an event which, in the absence of mitigation, can 
result in failure, if insufficient resistance exists… 
Mitigation (defense) -…type and effectiveness of every mitigation measure designed to 
block or reduce an exposure. 
Resistance – measure or estimate of the ability of the component to absorb the exposure 
force without failure, once the exposure reaches the component…” 
The application of relative assessment/index models in IM programs led to questions 
regarding “weights” for likelihood scores of individual and interacting threats and their 
relative contributions to failure likelihood.  This issue arose because some models treated 
the likelihood contributions from all threats equally in the total risk estimates, and did not 
consider interacting threats.  This is a distortion because, historically, different threats have 
caused failures with different frequency.  [For example, past failure history indicates threats 
like corrosion, material cracking, and third-party damage have been the cause of failures 
with greater frequency and impact than other threats.] 
To correct this distortion, some models apply fixed numerical weights as multipliers to each 
threat’s likelihood score and add the weighted scores to obtain a total likelihood score.  
However, the weights are often based on risk model vendor’s historical averages using data 
from diverse pipelines.  Consequently, applying such averaged weights introduces additional 
distortion in the likelihood estimates intended to represent specific segments on specific 
pipelines with location-specific risk factors.  To represent risk in the most accurate way 
possible, the risk assessment model should accurately account for segment-specific 
parameters of each segment of the pipeline being evaluated.  
This is an issue affecting relative assessment/index models or qualitative models only, 
because Quantitative System models do not use fixed weights to normalize threat-specific 
likelihood of failure estimates for specific segments, although the quantitative estimates 
may use historical data as an input to the model.

When considering different modeling approaches, it is important to keep the overall 
purpose of risk modeling in mind – to understand the likelihood of threats to and 
consequences of a failure for a pipeline segment, and to identify measures to reduce 
and manage the risks.  When a single approach is applied to all threats, the detail 
needed to model more complex threats adequately may be applied to other threats, 
even if a simpler approach is sufficient.  Some operators may choose a threat-specific 
approach to risk modeling rather than a single approach for all threats to optimize 
available resources and reduce model complexity. 
In practice, pipeline operators, particularly for smaller systems, often select approaches to risk 
modeling with the primary consideration of resource availability.  Some modeling approaches 
are viewed as complex and costly, whereas other approaches may not be detailed enough to 
adequately model risk for specific threats.  In addition, there can be a natural tendency for 
analysts to seek a single measure to characterize the overall risk for a pipeline segment.  This 
can lead to the assumption that only a single approach should be taken to model pipeline risk. 
A single risk value is of interest when evaluating the relative level of risk between different parts 
of a pipeline system, or when an absolute estimate of risk is needed.  However, different threat
specific risk modeling approaches may be preferable, even if they do not result in a singular 
measure of likelihood or risk.  For example, if one threat is thought to require a more detailed 
evaluation than others (e.g., stress corrosion cracking), operators should not feel like they must 
treat all threats with the same level of heightened sophistication if it is not needed.  Less 
sophisticated models may be sufficient for the other threats. 
Finding an appropriate balance of complexity, cost, and applicability of results is a challenge 
unique to each pipeline being analyzed.  Figures IV-1 and IV-2 show the general outlines of these 
differing approaches (the multiple arrows in Figure IV-2 indicate threat-specific modeling 
approaches vs. the singular modeling approach shown in Figure IV-1). 
One challenge to a threat-specific approach is the comparison of output results from the 
different approaches.  The ability to compare results is important to evaluating which risks are 
the most important to address and promoting the efficient use of resources for implementing 
preventive measures across the pipeline operator’s assets.  One way to address this challenge is 
to extend the threat-specific analysis to include consequences, and then comparing threat
specific risk estimates, combining likelihood and consequences.  Comparison of consequence 
estimates is generally more straightforward, as consequence estimates can be characterized by 
a common output such as expected loss.

 Historical failure experience shows that pipeline operator actions can have a significant effect on 
the likelihood of failure and the level of consequences following a pipeline failure.  PHMSA has 
observed that these risk factors may be underrepresented in operator risk models.  To fully 
represent the likelihood of failure, the risk model should include inputs related to human 
performance, and the model algorithms should include the relationship of these factors to other 
risk factors in the overall evaluation of risk.  Risk modeling of human errors can be accounted for 
in various ways for likelihood estimates, including: 
1. A threat category that represents operator actions that are the apparent cause 
of failures, e.g., “incorrect operation.”  While PHMSA incident and accident data 
often list “small” percentages for “incorrect operation” as an apparent cause,34 
34 https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-20-year-trends 
February 1, 2020 
38 
February 1, 2020  
probable and root cause analyses commonly find human performance as a 
leading contributory cause and cause of incidents and accidents as well as 
exacerbating the consequences of the failure. 
2. Failures in other threat categories may stem from human errors.  For example, 
“equipment failure” may result from maintenance, or design and construction 
human errors. 
3. Consideration of interactive threats includes interactions between threats due 
to operator actions.  For example, the threat category “incorrect operation” has 
potential interaction with threats in multiple categories.  One example is a 
crack-like defect introduced during the manufacture of a seam weld along with 
failure of the operator to properly account for the effects of pressure-cycle
induced fatigue on potential seam defects.35 
4. Potential human errors added to the uncertainty in the likelihood of failure 
given integrity assessment results, i.e., assessment results are subject to 
mischaracterization and misidentification of repair conditions. 
Operator actions, or lack of actions, can often overlap between likelihood and consequence 
aspects of pipeline risk modeling.  Actions taken in response to failures can affect the severity of 
consequences.  They can also directly impact likelihood modeling when differing characteristic 
of pipeline releases is involved (e.g., likelihood of small vs. medium vs. large releases).  
Dependencies of potential release levels on operator actions should be considered in the model 
to correctly characterize risk.   
The threats represented in a pipeline risk model may be interactive, because mechanisms that 
drive the likelihood of failure from one threat may be intensified by mechanisms driving the 
likelihood of failure from another threat.  The interaction of the mechanisms driving both 
threats increases the total likelihood of failure from the combined threats.  Multiple threats may 
also interact and result in an otherwise premature failure at a location on the pipeline.  A study 
sponsored by PHMSA36 uses a similar concept to define interacting threats as “two or more 
threats acting on a pipe or pipeline segment that increase the probability of failure to a level 
greater than the effects of the individual threats acting alone.” 
This study further points out that “…In order for threats to be interacting, they must act to cause 
a condition or situation that is more severe than that created by individual threats.  It is 
important to note that threats are not necessarily interacting simply because they exist at the 
same location on a pipe or pipeline.”

To provide an appropriate likelihood of failure estimate, the risk model should account for the 
interaction of multiple threats.  In addition, identification of effective preventive measures and 
evaluation of the effect of preventive measures on reducing the likelihood of failure should 
include consideration of interacting threats. 
One example of threat interaction is external corrosion or cracking on pipe damaged by denting 
that has not yet failed.  If the pipe damage caused external coating damage or coating shielding 
in an area of ineffective cathodic protection, then the pipe is more susceptible to external 
corrosion and cracking and the resulting likelihood of failure is increased.  Another example is 
earth movement around a pipeline that exacerbates construction-related imperfections such as 
wrinkle-bends or certain vintages of girth welds. 
The likelihood of failure from each threat includes a portion that involves that threat alone and a 
portion that involves interaction with other threats.  To evaluate the likelihood of failure from 
multiple threats, the risk model should appropriately account for both portions.  To illustrate, 
consider the following example of two threats.  The likelihood of failure (probability) from the 
two threats can be expressed as: 
�
�𝑇 = 𝑃1 + 𝑃2+𝑃𝑖 
Where   
P1 = failure probability from threat 1 individual factors  
P2 = failure probability from threat 2 individual factors 
Pi = failure probability from threat 1 and threat 2 interactions 
Pi in this expression is evaluated by considering the increased conditional probability of failure 
from threat 2, given the interactive factors from threat 1.  In this example, the increased 
likelihood of failure from external corrosion due to ineffective CP combined with the existing 
coating damage from previous pipe damage will be higher than the likelihood of failure from 
external corrosion if no coating damage is assumed.  Accordingly, that will increase the 
probability Pi in the above expression37 used to evaluate the probability of failure from either 
threat. 
Defining the interactions between different threats is an important activity in pipeline risk 
model development.  It enhances the accuracy of the model as a representation of the risk of 
the pipeline.  Additionally, the process of investigating and defining potential threat interactions 
can uncover failure causes that may not be immediately apparent.  For a complete risk analysis, 
the definition of risk factors and assignment of values to model inputs for a pipeline segment 
should involve consideration of threat interactions.  Both historical data and SME input should 
be employed to define potential threat interactions.  Analysis of historical failure data may point 
to failures resulting from interactive threats where pipe characteristics are similar to the 
37  The expression for the probability of failure from either threat is simplified by assuming the multiplied terms of 
the probability expression (P1 x P2, P1 x Pi, P2 x Pi, etc., are small relative to the probabilities P1, P2, and Pi.

pipeline being modeled.  SMEs with local knowledge can identify segments with characteristics 
that make them susceptible to interacting threats. 
Munoz and Rosenthal38 identified combinations of threat types that could potentially interact.  
The study, based on a literature search, SME surveys, and analysis of accident/incident historical 
data, identified 98 threat interactions considered “reasonably possible” and depicted these 
threat interactions in a matrix, shown below in Table IV-1.39 Interacting threats are indicated by 
a “1” in the matrix entry for each pair of threats that interact.  Footnotes to the table give 
conditions when the threats might interact.

Threat interactions such as shown in Table IV-1 should be incorporated in risk models at 
locations where they are found applicable.   
Fault trees may be used to model interacting threats explicitly by representing shared failure 
mechanisms as the same basic event in the models for each of the interacting threats.  When 
the likelihood of failure due to the interacting threats is quantified using the fault tree logic, 
then the combined likelihood of failure from the threats will correctly represent the 
contribution of the interactions.  This is shown in Figure IV-3 below, using the example of 
external corrosion and excavation damage.  Note that the threat interaction event under both 
external corrosion and excavation damage is identical. 
42 
February 1, 2020 
February 1, 2020  
Threats that act on pipelines independently (e.g., external and internal corrosion) may also act 
simultaneously at the same location on a pipeline.  If such conditions are identified, by integrity 
assessment methods or otherwise, then this would impact the evaluation of the likelihood of 
failure at the location where both threats are impacting the pipeline.  For a valid estimate of 
likelihood of failure, the risk model should reflect the composite effect of both threats, based on 
the identified condition of the pipe. 
Muhlbauer40 states that some threat interactions may be considered in the “triad” approach to 
failure modeling (see Section IV.B of this document) by modeling varying “resistance” according 
to the mechanisms that define the interaction.  In the external corrosion/excavation damage 
interaction example discussed previously, this would mean that modeling the resistance of the 
pipeline to the external corrosion threat is reduced in areas of excavation activity, by a factor 
that represents the likelihood that the excavation activity results in coating damage. 
Screening threats can have a distinct impact on risk analysis results.  As part of IM rule 
requirements, operators must determine the applicability of specific threats to pipeline 
40  Muhlbauer, Pipeline Risk Assessment: The Definitive Approach and its Role in Risk Management, 2015.

segments for the purposes of conducting integrity assessments41 and repairing anomalies.  
However, PHMSA has noted in pipeline inspections and failure investigations that operators are 
applying the threat screening criteria for integrity assessments to risk models, causing threats 
deemed insufficiently significant to require an integrity assessment to be inappropriately 
excluded from risk models.   
IM regulations require pipeline integrity assessment and repairs of identified pipe anomalies for 
pipeline segments that could affect HCAs.  Operators may also carry out integrity assessments 
beyond the HCA-affecting segments.  Integrity assessment methods are employed for specific 
threats of concern (corrosion, cracking, mechanical damage).  Operators base decisions on 
which integrity assessment methods to apply on an evaluation of the susceptibility of pipeline 
segments to specific threats.  If a particular threat is not considered significant on a segment, 
then an integrity assessment method associated with that threat is not specifically required.   
However, when a threat is eliminated from consideration for integrity assessment, the threat 
must not be eliminated from inclusion in a risk model used to evaluate other risk reducing 
measures.  In other words, if a threat is not deemed significant enough to warrant application of 
a specific integrity assessment method, it does not necessarily mean that threat can be 
discarded from the likelihood analysis in the overall risk model nor can data stop being collected 
on that threat.  To do so may lead to an incomplete risk evaluation and erroneous 
determinations of risk reduction measures.  Many threats do not warrant that a unique integrity 
assessment technique be applied but are nonetheless valid for the consideration of risk 
reduction measures.  The basis for screening out threats from consideration for integrity 
assessment must be documented and maintained for the useful life of the pipeline (in 
accordance with §§ 192.947 and 195.452(l)). 
The pipeline risk model should represent all relevant threats.  It is important that the threats 
included in the model are not limited only to those that have caused pipeline failure historically.  
Rather, the model should include other threats that have caused failures within the pipeline 
industry and could do so in the future because of pipe characteristics and changing conditions 
affecting the pipeline.  On some segments, pipeline characteristics may result in the model 
estimating a negligible likelihood of failure for one or more threats (e.g., several orders of 
magnitude lower than higher likelihood threats).  Such a result can be justification for reduced 
priority of additional measures to prevent failures from the negligible threats.  However, such 
decisions must be made carefully to ensure a complete and accurate risk analysis.  Additional 
considerations include: 
41 “Integrity assessment” refers to method(s) used to assess the integrity of the line pipe for identified threats. 
More than one method may be required to address all the threats to a pipeline segment (49 CFR Part 192, 
Subpart O).  Current pipeline code sections can be accessed at the U.S. Government Printing Office web site at:

1. Threat screening should consider the severity of consequences, as threats 
presenting a low likelihood of failure may be risk-significant if the failure modes 
could result in especially severe consequences. 
2. If measures are taken to reduce the likelihood of failure from other threats, then the 
likelihood of failure from the screened-out threats should be reconsidered to 
determine if they are significant for a segment. 
3. Interactions with other threats should be evaluated.  Threats with low risk when 
considered individually may still interact with other threats and result in a significant 
risk. 
4. Uncertainties in the assumptions and basis for model parameter values should be 
examined to determine if the likelihood of failure from a threat could be higher with 
small changes.  If the uncertainties indicate that the likelihood of failure from the 
threat could be considerably higher, then evaluation of the threat should be 
included in the model.  Understanding the shape of probability distributions for 
inputs can provide important insights into the effect of uncertainty and identify 
when actions to reduce uncertainty can impact decisions and yield significant risk 
reductions. 
Integrity Management regulations require risk assessment to support identification of risk 
reduction measures to prevent and mitigate the consequences of a pipeline failure that could 
affect a high consequence area42 and evaluation of the likelihood of a pipeline release occurring 
and how a release could affect the high consequence area.43  Section 192.935(a) requires that an 
operator take additional measures beyond those already required by Part 192 to prevent a 
pipeline failure and to mitigate the consequences of a pipeline failure in a high consequence 
area.  Section 195.452(i) requires that an operator must take measures to prevent and mitigate 
the consequences of a pipeline failure that could affect a high consequence area.  “Preventive” 
measures reduce the likelihood of failure through additional protection against threats.   
A risk model that supports an evaluation of the effect of implementing preventive measures has 
an output measuring likelihood of failure that is capable of reflecting changes due to preventive 
measures and estimating the differences in risk due to the changes.  Changes can be 
represented in the model by changing the values assigned to variables or by making changes to 
the model structure (e.g., adding a variable to represent increased redundancy of measures 
combatting a threat). 
The effectiveness of different types of models in supporting risk-based decisions, including 
decisions on preventive measures, was discussed in Section III.A.  A risk model can support 
42 49 CFR §§ 195.452 (i)(1) and 192.935(a).   
43 49 CFR §§ 195.452 (i)(2), 192.911(c), and 192.917(c)).

identification and evaluation of preventive measures.  To assist identification, sensitivity analysis 
can be conducted to help examine which threats and model inputs are driving the risk results.  
Preventive measures can be defined to address the most important risk drivers.   
One method of performing such a sensitivity analysis is to reduce the value assigned to each 
model input variable one by one by a fixed percentage (e.g., 25-50 percent), leaving the other 
variables fixed at their best estimated values.  The risk is then reevaluated using the revised 
input value.  After this is repeated for all variables, the results can be compared.  The variables 
that drive the biggest changes in the likelihood of failure could represent the risk factors with 
the best potential for risk reduction by preventive measures.   
This evaluation can be performed on the entire pipeline or on specific pipeline segments.  If 
considering the entire pipeline, the analysis results would show risk factors that have the 
greatest overall potential for risk reduction.  If conducted separately for specific pipeline 
segments, the results indicate the factors that have greatest potential for risk reduction on 
those segments.  If relatively few segments dominate the risk of the entire pipeline, then 
concentrating on the risk factors and potential preventive measures for the high-risk segments 
may present an efficient path to reducing risk. 
Once risk drivers are identified, preventive measures may be defined to reduce the likelihood of 
failure.  The risk reduction that may be achieved by implementing a measure is estimated by 
evaluating the baseline risk (i.e., without the preventive measure), evaluating the risk assuming 
the preventive measure is implemented, and calculating the difference as the estimated risk 
reduction.  When this evaluation is performed for each preventive measure under 
consideration, the estimated effectiveness of all individual preventive measures is compared, 
necessary resources to complete each measure are calculated, and the most effective set of 
measures given available resources will be shown. 
When estimating the significance of risk factors or the risk reduction achieved by preventive 
measures, the effects of interacting threats should be evaluated (see Section IV.E above).  In 
addition, although the analysis may include preventive measures, the analysis to evaluate the 
potential benefit of a preventive measure should also include consequences to determine the 
overall risk reduction (versus just the reduction of likelihood).  Any dependencies between 
likelihood and consequences should also be included, since these can affect the overall risk 
estimates. 
For example, reducing the likelihood of failure from a particular threat may affect the 
distribution of failure modes (e.g., rupture vs. leak), which may then affect the distribution of 
release volume or the likelihood of different operator actions to limit a release.  If a threat is 
reduced that has a higher than average proportion of failure by leak rather than rupture (e.g., 
corrosion), then the remaining distribution of failure modes will have a higher proportion of 
46

failure by rupture, and the consequence and risk model outputs will need to be adjusted 
accordingly.44  
• The use of fixed numerical weights applied to risk factors and/or categories can 
introduce distortions in the likelihood of failure estimates from relative 
assessment/index models for specific pipeline segments.  These distortions should 
be corrected as part of the necessary adjustments to apply the output from these 
models to the evaluation of risk reducing measures affecting specific segments. 
• Uncertainties in the values of model variables can be important to the conclusions 
of a risk analysis and should be carefully evaluated.  The likelihood of failure due to 
a threat should be evaluated in the context of uncertainties and the potential for 
consequences given the threat.   
• Estimates of the likelihood of failure should be periodically validated, including 
evaluation of model inputs and outputs, to ensure the risk model accurately 
represents pipeline system risks. 
• Identification of the most important model inputs or risk “drivers” is critical to 
understanding if the model outputs are technically valid.  Risk model factors found 
to be important to the output risk levels should be reasonable when reviewed by 
SMEs or compared with historical data (both industry-wide and operator-specific). 
• When risk analysis involves multiple threats, the effects of threat interactions or 
dependencies on the likelihood of failure should be evaluated.  The threat 
interactions shown in Table IV-1 are recommend for inclusion where applicable.  
Other interactions found to be applicable at specific locations or in unique operating 
environments should be evaluated. 
• The risk assessment should include modeling of human interactions that are 
significant to the likelihood of failure or have a significant effect on consequences 
following a failure. 
• Different modeling methods may be applied to assessing the likelihood of failure 
due to different threats.  Threat-specific modeling methods may necessarily vary 
and may not always be amenable to characterize risk as one composite risk value. 
44  While the leak to rupture threshold has been historically set at operating pressures of 30 percent SMYS 
(specified minimum yield strength), it is important to note that recent work by Kiefner and Associates and 
Kleinfelder has demonstrated that ruptures occur below 20 percent SMYS when interacting threats are present 
(see http://kiefner.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Study_of_pipelines_
that_ruptured_at_stress_below_30pct_SMYS__PPIM_2013_paper.pdf).  Operators should be aware of threat 
interactions when minimizing the consequence of a failure based on their assumption that the failure will only 
leak and not rupture.

V. Consequence Modeling 
This section provides information on important characteristics of consequence, the second fundamental 
part of the risk definition and formula.45  In the general risk definition, consequence represents and 
evaluates the severity and loss associated with an unwanted event.  In pipeline risk modeling, the 
unwanted event is failure of a pipeline system or portion of a pipeline system.  The consequence portion 
of a pipeline risk model encompasses the scenarios following a pipeline failure.  The risk model uses the 
factors driving those scenarios and the interrelationships among risk factors to estimate the overall 
consequence of failure to potential receptors.  Depending on the release characteristics, receptors may 
be at the point of failure of the segment or may be some distance away.  To estimate consequences, the 
model should therefore include input variables representing important characteristics of a pipeline 
segment, including the product being transported and the location of the segment, and the potential 
paths of release dispersion between the segment and consequence receptors.  These variables 
represent all factors needed to estimate the consequences of failure for all points along the segment. 
The consequence analysis begins with consideration of a pipeline failure at a specific location and ends 
with estimates of the impacts that could occur from a release following the failure at that location.  To 
evaluate the consequences of failure, the model includes and estimates the following dependent 
elements of a release: 
1. Product Hazard: What kind of damage could the pipeline’s transported product cause to 
receptors (e.g., flammability, toxicity)? 
2. Release rate and volume: How much liquid or vapor could be released? 
3. Release dispersion characteristics: Where, how, and when could the released product 
travel? 
4. Receptors: Who or what could be impacted negatively by the release given the product 
hazard, volume, and dispersion? 
5. Expected Loss: What is the estimated worth to the operator and other stakeholders of 
avoiding impacts to receptors and direct losses from a release? 
a. Receptors of a release may be diverse (e.g., the public, operator personnel, the 
environment, private and public property).  Consequences can be measured 
individually for the different types of receptors, but optimal decision making can 
be facilitated if consequences can be translated into a single value equivalent 
that represents total loss from the consequences (e.g., dollars).  If a unified 
measure of consequence is needed for risk assessment or decision-making, then 
a consistent and defensible method to measure the magnitude of consequences 
to different receptors is needed. 
The first four46 elements are estimated based on data and information on the objective characteristics of 
the pipeline and its location.  However, “Expected Loss” is a more subjective measure that ultimately 
45  See sections I and II.B of the document above.

represents the realities, attitudes, and preferences of the operator organization and other stakeholders.  
For example, respective pipeline operators conduct operations in widely varying population densities, 
physical environments, regulatory environments, have varying levels of ability to cope with accident 
costs, etc., and have organization-specific levels of risk tolerance. 
Conceptually, the evaluation of consequences is a function of these elements, with the estimates for 
each element dependent on previous elements:

Sections V.A through V.D of this document provide additional information on risk model treatment of 
consequence. 
Consequences of pipeline failures can differ widely because of a variety of factors, including the 
differences in hazards and dispersion characteristics of different commodities.  Table V-1 shows 
the names of commercially available consequence analysis models that have been used to 
estimate safety consequences for different commodities.47  These models cover different 
elements of the consequence analysis described in Sections V.A.1 through V.A.4.

CFD Modelling  
A consequence analysis approach should address all elements of a product release following 
a pipeline failure, including hazards of the released product, release rate and volume, 
dispersion characteristics, and receptor impacts.  Exclusion of any element results in an 
incomplete analysis and unreliable results.  Sections V.A.1 through V.A.5 below provide 
information on each of the consequence analysis elements, the inputs and outputs of each 
element, and the needs from risk models to support each element.   
A.1 Hazard 
Input: Pipeline commodity properties. 
Output: Hazards to consequence receptors. 
The analysis should consider acute hazards of the released products such as 
flammability, toxicity, and mechanical effects of a release, as well as chronic hazards 
such as environmental contamination.  Acute thermal hazards can include effects from 
immediate or delayed ignition. 
For a complete analysis, all hazards of all commodities that are transported in the 
pipeline should be included in the risk model.  If multiple commodities are transported, 
then the hazards of all of them should be included.  For example, a hazardous liquid 
pipeline could transport different types of HVLs, crude oil pipelines can carry sour crude 
and non-sour crude, refined products pipelines can carry jet-A fuel and high-octane 
gasolines, and natural gas pipelines can carry high BTU gas as well as lower BTU gas and 
some natural gas condensates.  Each product that a pipeline transports comes with 
distinct hazards to humans and the environment and distinct dispersion characteristics 
over land, water, and air. 
Even if the pipeline transports a single commodity type, release of the commodity could 
result in multiple hazards.  Limiting the scope of the consequence analysis to only the 
most frequently transported commodity or the “most significant hazard” could result in 
48  “CFD” stands for “Computational Fluid Dynamics.”

excluding risk-significant scenarios from the risk analysis.  Often, the consequences of 
one hazard will dominate some locations, but for other locations, multiple hazards will 
each have an important contribution to risk.49 
A.2 Volume 
Input: Pipeline characteristics, location characteristics, failure modes, and commodity 
properties. 
Output: Release volumes at each location following a failure. 
For a complete risk assessment, the consequence analysis should include consideration 
of a wide range of scenarios to estimate the volume of commodity that might be 
released following a pipeline failure.  Volume is an uncertain quantity, so a complete 
analysis may require consideration of multiple scenarios to estimate the range of 
volumes that could be released.  Volume estimate scenarios are defined by input 
variables that affect release volumes, including the leak or rupture size, the flow rate 
through the pipe failure, the time required to detect the leak or rupture, the effect and 
timing of operator actions, the location of valves that could be used to isolate and limit 
the release, and the elevation profile of the pipeline.  Considering of a range of possible 
scenarios, including both large and small failure sizes, better ensures that the highest 
risk scenarios are covered.  Concentrating on only on one scenario (e.g., largest rupture) 
may not result in the highest release volume or the highest risk level. 
At each potential release location, the range and distribution of failure sizes is 
dependent on the distribution of failure modes (leak vs. rupture).  The distribution of 
failure modes is dependent on the distribution of the likelihood of failure from different 
threats, because threats have varying frequencies of failure in different modes.  For 
example, corrosion failures on pipe with higher toughness properties tend to have a 
lower likelihood of rupture than seam and cracking failures or excavation damage.  
Therefore, the range of release volumes at each location is dependent of the 
distribution of threats at the location.  For an accurate consequence estimate, the risk 
model algorithm should preserve this dependency. 
To properly represent risk, the volume estimate should encompass the range of 
possibilities experienced in applicable historical releases.  Historical data beyond the 
specific pipeline being analyzed should be included when considering the range of 
possible release volumes.  If historical releases are considered inapplicable, the analysis 
should explain exclusion of these scenarios from consideration.   
49  For example, the 1999 Olympic Pipeline/Bellingham, Washington, accident caused three fatalities, two resulting 
from fire and one from fumes causing loss of consciousness.   Document can be accessed at: 
https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAR0202.pdf.

It may be useful for an operator to consider a fixed set of hole sizes based upon types of 
expected failures (e.g., pinhole, corrosion hole, small rupture, etc.) Release rates can 
then be calculated for each size and used as the basis for determine release volumes 
while incorporating other information, such as estimated response times. 
A.3 Dispersion 
Input: Release rate and volume, commodity properties, location and dispersion path 
characteristics, emergency response to spill. 
Output: Locations where receptors are subject to hazards from released commodities. 
To support a complete consideration of potential consequences, the analysis should 
consider all dispersion methods and pathways that could result in adverse 
consequences to receptors, recognizing that pathways and magnitudes of dispersion are 
uncertain.  The consequences of a pipeline release to impact potential receptors depend 
on the extent and direction of release dispersion.  Dispersion depends on the product 
characteristics, volume released, geographic features around the pipeline, and 
environmental conditions.  Depending on the released commodity and location 
characteristics, the release may disperse by air, soil, or water.  Variable atmospheric and 
waterway conditions (e.g., wind direction and speed, water flow velocity) should be 
considered to include the full range of possible dispersion of the released commodity.  
Consideration of both high-likelihood and high-consequence dispersion scenarios is 
essential to a full evaluation of risk.  It may also be that the most likely scenario is not 
the highest-risk scenario. 
For released liquids, dispersion by land and water is frequently modeled using a digital 
elevation model (DEM) to trace potential spill flow paths, along with stream locations 
integrated in a GIS (see example in Figure V-1).  Dispersion by water is particularly 
important to analyze, since waterways provide paths for the spill to reach more 
receptors further from the spill location.  For very small spill volumes that occur away 
from waterbodies, detailed dispersion modeling may not be warranted, if the spill is 
unlikely to disperse beyond the immediate vicinity of its origin. 
To initiate integrity management programs, pipeline operators were required to identify 
which of their pipeline segments could affect high consequence areas.  Operators 
continue to update those analyses as an ongoing part of their IM programs.  The 
analyses may involve use of elements of consequence models that include hazard 
identification, spill volume estimates, and dispersion estimates.

A.4 Receptors  
Input: Locations subject to hazards following release. 
Output: Receptors in locations subject to hazard after release and dispersion. 
The magnitude and direction of release dispersion defines the areas subject to release 
hazards, the potential receptors of release consequences in the hazard areas, and the 
severity of impacts.  Depending on the hazards involved, potential receptors may be 
near the failure location on the pipeline, or they may be some distance away 
(particularly in scenarios where the released commodity may be transported by water).  
Potential receptors include: 
• Persons occupying the hazard area (homes, workplaces, schools, 
hospitals, etc.) that could be injured or killed. 
• Features of the natural environment (water resources, flora and fauna, 
etc.) that could be damaged or contaminated. 
• Structures and other property that could be damaged or destroyed. 
A.5 Expected Loss 
Input: Consequences to receptors from a release. 
Output: Expected loss due to consequences. 
A measure of loss is needed to allow comparison of the expected loss from a pipeline 
failure to the resource expenditure of risk reduction measures, to help evaluate their 
relative effectiveness.  Some consequences, such as the direct monetary costs of a 
release, including property damage, relocation costs, environmental cleanup costs, and 
paid civil and legal penalties, are directly comparable to the increased capital and 
operating costs required to implement risk reducing measures.  However, release 
consequences could include additional impacts that are not readily measured by direct

53 
February 1, 2020  
monetary costs, including human casualties, ecological damage, damage to company 
reputation with regulators or the public, and product supply problems.  If the analysis 
includes only monetary costs, it could understate the total loss from releases.  
Depending on the type of pipeline and the release, the societal impacts of such 
consequences could far exceed the direct monetary costs to the operator. 
A common method for establishing a single-valued measure of the loss from diverse 
consequences is to convert all consequences to monetary equivalents.  Operators are 
often reluctant to express losses due to fatalities and injuries in monetary terms.  
However, if human safety consequences are not included in the calculation of expected 
loss from failures, then the loss will be understated and the benefits of potential risk 
reducing measures will be undervalued.  To fully characterize the loss from pipeline 
failure consequences, operators should include the cost of human casualties, along with 
other non-monetary costs, in the overall measure of consequences.  The U.S. 
Department of Transportation has provided guidance50 on the value of avoiding human 
casualties, prescribing a Value of Statistical Life (VSL) figure of $9.6 Million (2015 dollars) 
for DOT analyses. 
In some applications, operators may choose one type of consequence, such as potential 
human casualties or environmental damage, and set decision criteria based on risk 
measures of this consequence only (e.g., expected fatalities per year).  An example of 
this approach is given in Appendix B.1, which uses “FN” curves51 as a guide for 
evaluating consequences based on human impacts.  If a single consequence type is used 
to evaluate risk reduction measures, then the benefits of the risk reduction measures 
could be understated, because risks in other categories that are not included in the 
decision criteria may also be reduced by the risk reduction measures being considered. 
Risk models may use an alternative to monetary equivalents to combine different types 
of consequences in a common measure of loss.  If so, the method chosen should reflect 
the organization’s relative valuation of the types of consequences involved.  Scales used 
to measure loss for different receptors (e.g., human casualties, environmental damage, 
economic) should be internally consistent, so that the same values are assigned to loss 
levels that are valued equivalently for all receptors. 
The responses of operator and emergency responders during an event are key factors in the 
severity of consequences from pipeline releases.  Failure detection capability and the speed and

efficacy of the emergency response can significantly impact the severity of the consequence of a 
release. 
Consequence analysis should consider ability to detect leaks of various sizes as well as time to 
respond and shut down and isolate the pipeline.  Overly optimistic expectations and 
assumptions about leak detection capabilities will likely lead to underestimating spill volumes 
and the associated consequences. 
For hazardous liquid pipelines, operators have often used spill response plan assumptions in risk 
models to estimate spill volume and dispersion direction and distance as the basis for 
consequence estimates.  Accident history indicates that although most pipeline accidents do not 
involve “maximum” or worst-case release estimates, in some cases, the anticipated level of 
consequences can be significantly underestimated.  For a balanced assessment of 
consequences, operators should avoid non-conservative assumptions or estimates regarding 
spill response actions that impact release volumes or dispersion. 
For example, the NTSB pipeline accident report for the July 25, 2010 Marshall, Michigan, crude 
oil pipeline rupture52 stated “During interviews, first responders said that they were unaware of 
the scale of the oil release; this lack of knowledge contributed to their poor decision-making.” In 
addition, NTSB concluded “that although Enbridge quickly isolated the ruptured segment of Line 
6B after receiving a telephone call about the release, Enbridge’s emergency response actions 
during the initial hours following the release were not sufficiently focused on source control and 
demonstrated a lack of awareness and training in the use of effective containment methods.” 
The NTSB pipeline accident report for the September 9, 2010, San Bruno, California, incident53 
concluded “…that the 95 minutes that PG&E took to stop the flow of gas by isolating the rupture 
site was excessive.  This delay, which contributed to the severity and extent of property damage 
and increased risk to the residents and emergency responders, in combination with the failure 
of the SCADA center to expedite shutdown of the remote valves at the Martin Station, 
contributed to the severity of the accident.” 
While not typical, historical high-consequence releases such as the Marshall, Michigan, and San 
Bruno, California, incidents illustrate that variability in human actions in response to a failure 
can compound other factors to significantly affect the consequences of the failure.  Emergency 
response time variation can depend on factors such a procedural complexity, logistical 
challenges, and the experience/training level of responders.  Identification of the actual release 
location and the ability to isolate the release can vary widely depending on pipeline location and

configuration, and surrounding population density.  Therefore, it is important for a complete 
and valid modeling of consequences that the model: 
1. Identify and incorporate all key human actions or decision points that can have a 
substantial impact on the level of consequences following a failure.  Even complex 
responses can generally be broken out into a relatively few major steps that should 
be accomplished to minimize the consequence of a release. 
2. Estimate the range of time that may be required to perform the key actions.  The 
estimate should include a sufficient range to cover the full uncertainty in response 
time.  Using a single point estimate for potentially important parameters such as the 
time to stop stream flow spill migration is not appropriate without substantial 
justification and can potentially skew consequence calculations. 
3. Estimate the key parameters that have a substantial impact on spill volume and 
dispersion given the range of possible response times and the effectiveness of the 
response. 
Given the uncertainty in response times, it may be useful to develop best-estimate, minimum, 
and maximum estimates (or a probability distribution for key response times) to more fully 
define the range of expected consequences for the releases being analyzed.  Consideration of a 
range or distribution of impacts from emergency response allows more insight on the range of 
risks than reliance on point estimates that might have originally been developed for other 
purposes. 
Integrity management regulations require risk assessment to support identification54 and 
evaluation55 of risk reducing (preventive and mitigative) measures.  Section 192.935(a) requires 
that an operator must take additional measures beyond those already required by Part 192 to 
prevent a pipeline failure and to mitigate the consequences of a pipeline failure in a high 
consequence area.  Section 195.452(i) requires that an operator must take measures to prevent 
and mitigate the consequences of a pipeline failure that could affect a high consequence area.  
“Mitigative” measures reduce the consequences of failure, through actions that reduce the 
product hazard, release volume, the dispersion of the release, or the exposure of receptors to 
the release.   
Risk models can support identification and evaluation of mitigative measures.  The effectiveness 
of different types of models in supporting decisions, including decisions on mitigative measures, 
was discussed in Section III.A.  To assist identification, sensitivity analysis can be conducted to 
54  49 CFR §§ 195.452 (i)(1) and 192.935(a).  Current pipeline code sections can be accessed at the U.S. Government

examine which consequence analysis inputs are driving the risk results.  Risk reduction measures 
can then be defined to address the most important risk drivers and mitigate the consequences 
of failure.  Consequences may be reduced by actions, such as: 
1. Reducing potential release volumes by: 
a. Installing new emergency flow restriction devices, remote control valves, or 
automatic shutoff valves. 
b. Improving leak detection systems or operator response to rupture indications. 
c. Installing more SCADA measurement points to allow for more precise 
monitoring and quicker determinations of pressure, flow, or temperature data 
reflective of pipeline operating conditions at specific locations.   
2. Reducing the potential for spill dispersion through such measures as secondary 
containment, positioning emergency equipment, or improving emergency response. 
3. Relocating receptors or relocating the pipeline to lower the potential for receptor 
impacts. 
These measures have varying levels of practicality and potential effectiveness.   
For a risk model to adequately support an analysis of the effects of additional mitigative 
measures, the model’s consequence evaluation should be capable of reflecting changes due to 
the projected mitigative measures and showing the differences in risk due to the changes, 
whether they be changes to the pipeline, operations, dispersion pathways, or location of 
potential receptors.  Changes can be represented in the model by changing the values assigned 
to variables or by making changes to the model structure. 
The potential risk reduction from implementing a measure is estimated by evaluating baseline 
risk (i.e., without the measure), evaluating risk assuming the measure is implemented, and 
calculating the difference as the estimated risk reduction.  The results can then be fit into a 
benefit-cost analysis of the risk-reducing measures under consideration.  When this evaluation is 
performed for each measure under consideration, the estimated effectiveness of all measures is 
compared, necessary resources to complete each measure are calculated, and the most 
effective set of measures given available resources will be shown. 
• To support decision making and the identification and evaluation of mitigative 
measures, the consequence analysis should encompass the five elements of hazard, 
release volume, dispersion, receptors, and estimated loss.  The impact of operator 
response actions and timing on these elements should be appropriately evaluated.   
• Varying levels of sophistication are possible in the consequence analysis, while still 
allowing for useful results, but it is important to consider a range of scenarios, defined 
by a range of values for key consequence variables, to capture the full spectrum of 
possible consequences.  Also, it is important to consider high-consequence scenarios, 
even if they have a low probability of occurrence. 
57 
February 1, 2020 
February 1, 2020  
• The quantitative information in the consequence analysis should represent the 
operator’s best current understanding of important variables that affect estimates of 
hazards, release volume, and dispersion.  Equally important is a consistent and complete 
measure of losses from estimated consequences.  If index scores, monetary equivalents, 
or other measure are used to represent the cost of consequences to diverse receptors, 
then the relative values assigned to different consequence levels should be internally 
consistent and represent the values of the operator organization or values used in 
societal decision making. 
• The risk analysis should include modeling of human interactions that have a significant 
effect on consequences following a failure. 
VI. 
Facility Risk Modeling 
Pipeline facility risk assessment is different from line pipe risk assessment, because facilities have 
different component types with different failure mechanisms and failure modes.  Consequence 
assessment can also be different because facilities are most often located on property controlled by the 
pipeline operator and not on public rights-of-way (ROW).  In general, facility risk models will measure 
the likelihood of failure for the facility location (or specific areas within a facility), rather than a 
likelihood per mile. 
Gas Transmission Facilities include: 
• Compressor stations 
• Regulator and Metering Stations 
Hazardous Liquid Transmission Facilities include: 
• Tank Facilities 
• Pump Stations 
• Metering Stations 
The liquid and gas IM regulations require HCA identification, risk assessment, and evaluation of 
preventive measures and mitigative measures for facilities as well as line pipe.  The IM regulations 
require integrity assessments for line pipe only.   
The same basic principles apply for risk assessment of facilities as for risk assessment of line 
pipe.  Risk assessment models for facilities should model likelihood and consequence.  All 
threats to integrity at the facility should be considered in the likelihood assessment.  All product 
hazards, dispersion paths, and receptors should be considered in the consequence assessment. 
58 
February 1, 2020 
February 1, 2020  
Risk assessment of facilities includes consideration of the failure modes considered for line pipe 
as well as additional failure modes introduced by the inclusion of other components, such as 
motive equipment (e.g., pumps, compressors).   
Some important aspects of facility risk include: 
• The concentration of complex equipment at facilities can result in a higher 
likelihood of failure due to threats like equipment failure and incorrect operation (as 
shown in historical incident data).   
• Equipment failure can be a more significant threat for facilities.  Factors such as 
vibration, excessive and varying temperatures, start-ups and shut-downs, wear, 
design and construction errors, and other aging/cycling effects affect motive 
equipment like compressors and pumps and can cause failures of equipment or 
associated piping. 
• Because of the complexity of most pipeline facilities, their failures represent a 
higher likelihood of service interruption.  Standard designs and regulations for 
facilities include alarms systems, emergency shut-down systems (ESD), site grading 
for control of lost product, and facility evacuation planning.  Most operators employ 
reliability engineering practices and predictive maintenance schemes to manage 
facility risk.  These factors should be included in the inputs of the facility risk model, 
as appropriate. 
• Facilities that are above ground may be more susceptible than buried assets to 
some outside force damage threats.   
• The operator’s analysis should consider the difference between risks for manned 
and unmanned facilities.   
Overall, facilities may have a smaller risk “footprint” than line pipe, and the geographic extent of 
consequences may not be as widespread.  Many facility components are above ground and 
accessible for inspection and maintenance activities, in contrast to mainly underground line 
pipe. 
To support improved facility operation, operators sometimes perform facility reliability analyses.  
The data and models for such analyses may be used as the basis for facility risk assessments, if 
they are augmented to include evaluation of consequences to receptors (e.g., human safety and 
environmental protection) both on and off the facility site.  Operators may use tools often 
applied to analyze the failure of facilities, such as HAZOP, FMEAs, fault trees, LOPA, or “bow-tie” 
analysis,56 as a starting point, expanding the analysis to consider failures that have offsite 
consequences and evaluating the risk of those failures.  Operators may also be able to apply the 
data sets developed for risk assessment for those other tools and analyses.

Appendix C contains an example qualitative risk model used for facility risk assessment. 
IM requirements for identification and evaluation of preventive measures and mitigative 
measures apply to facilities as well as line pipe.  These regulations require operators take 
additional measures to prevent a pipeline failure and to mitigate the consequences of a failure 
that could affect a high consequence area.59  The same model types (Section II.D) are available 
for facility risk assessment as line-pipe risk assessment, with the same capabilities to support 
decision making (Section III.A), although the threats and consequences evaluated using the 
models will be somewhat different for facilities.   
For example, one hazardous liquid pipeline operator uses a relative assessment (index) model to 
assess risk at tank facilities.  The model includes a likelihood index and leak impact factor 
(consequence) index.  The likelihood index scores factors in the following categories: 
• Design and Materials 
• Incorrect Operations 
• Corrosion 
• External Forces 
The design and materials category includes scores for such factors as: 
• Material operating stress and cyclic stress  
• Material vibration  
• Safety systems predictive and preventive maintenance program  
• Failure history of equipment like pumps, valves, tubing, and control and 
instrumentation 
The leak impact factor index scores factors for product hazard, receptors, and spill size. 
The design of many facilities includes telemetry, monitoring, and automatic shutdown and 
isolation systems.  These instrument and control systems continuously monitor for leakage, 
explosive gas mixtures, fire, vibration, component temperature, intrusion, operating pressure, 
etc., and automatically isolate the system when alarm thresholds are exceeded.  The required

maintenance for these facilities often follows manufacturers’ recommendations along with 
reliability engineering concepts to develop preventive actions to assure system availability, 
reducing the risk of failure.  Risk models should support the evaluation of enhancements to 
equipment design, maintenance, inspection, and operation and the effects of such 
enhancements on risk.   
With a risk model, changes in the likelihood of failure of different equipment can be made to 
represent reliability enhancements from changes to design, maintenance, testing, or operating 
practices.  The risk model’s algorithm can be altered to represent design changes that add 
redundancy or introduce automation.  The risk model can be used to evaluate the likelihood of 
failure with and without the improvements to estimate the resulting changes in risk.  The 
changes in risk values can be compared to the cost of implementing the enhancement if 
alternative risk reduction measures are being compared or benefit-cost analysis is being 
conducted to evaluate the measures. 
• Facility characteristics that affect risk may be significantly different than those for line 
pipe.  Different failure causes may be important and failures may have different 
consequences than nearby line pipe.  However, the same basic principles apply for risk 
assessment of facilities as for risk assessment of line pipe and the same types of models 
may be applied. 
• Incorrect operation, human error, and equipment failure can be important failure 
threats for facility risk and should be represented thoroughly in facility risk models. 
• Existing operational approaches to assess facility reliability can often be adapted for 
evaluation of risk and off-site consequences and should be utilized where possible. 
VII. 
Risk Modeling Data 
Previous sections of this document concentrated on the structure of risk models and their use in 
supporting decisions on operator activities to control risks.  This section discusses developing the values 
for input variables to risk models.   
Model inputs should represent the best currently available information on risk factors for both the 
likelihood and consequences of pipeline failures.  Inputs should draw data from both pipeline system 
records and the knowledgeable and informed opinion of subject matter experts (SMEs).  Both data from 
records and SME input should be validated to ensure applicability as risk model inputs. 
Using pipeline records to develop risk model inputs can be a large-scale effort, because of the wide 
variety of records involved and because pipeline characteristics can change considerably over the length 
of the pipeline.  The operational and inspection history of pipeline segments can also vary significantly 
over the length of the pipeline.  Other model inputs related to the environment in which the pipeline 
62 
February 1, 2020 
February 1, 2020  
operates (e.g., terrain, soil types, and area characteristics around the pipeline) can also change 
significantly over the entire pipeline route.  SME information should be used to fill gaps in information 
for model inputs as data from records is being assembled and validated and when inputs cannot be 
derived from any available records.  Operators should revise field data acquisition forms to capture the 
data and information required to support their risk assessment and Geospatial Information Systems 
(GIS).  Staff responsible for completing field data acquisition forms should be trained on the forms’ 
requirements to meet the data quality expectations of the groups relying on this data to make decisions.   
An important feature of input data for a pipeline risk model is a “Linear Reference System” (LRS) to tie 
risk factors to specific points or segments on the pipeline.  Factors can be “linear” (e.g., pipe segments, 
HCA-affecting segments, class locations, inline inspection (ILI) ranges, MAOP/MOP, test pressure) or 
single “points” (e.g., facilities, valves, crossings, features or anomalies identified by ILI, girth welds).  The 
reference system that specifies risk factor locations within the pipeline is integrated with a 
“geographical” location system to tie points and segments on the pipeline with the location of specific 
features around the pipeline (e.g., HCAs, buildings, bodies of water, elevation changes).  In the context 
of risk models, this is necessary to align risk factors, affecting both the likelihood and consequences of a 
release, so that each location on the pipeline is appropriately represented by inputs to the risk model.  
This allows the risk model outputs to reflect the unique combination of risk factors representative at 
each location. 
A GIS is useful to house data on the locations of pipeline characteristics and geographical features.  If the 
operator does not use a GIS, then other methods should be used to accurately assign risk factors to the 
correct locations along the pipeline.  SME knowledge on the relative location of pipeline-related factors 
and geographic features may be necessary to align these factors for input to the risk model.   
In a risk model, sufficient distinction of model outputs at specific locations and insights about pipeline 
segment risks is enhanced by “dynamic segmentation,” where separate risk model results are generated 
for pipe segments that have significantly different risk factors or significantly different levels of risk.  
Operators should define criteria for defining the segments with separate risk estimates.  Under this 
approach, illustrated in Figure VII-1, a model would estimate risk separately for each segment where risk 
factors are distinct.  In the figure, the distinct segments are indicated by the dashed vertical lines.  For 
example, the first (leftmost) segment extends to where the “HCA” factor changes from “Yes” to “No”; 
the second segment extends from this point to where the “Road Proximity,” “Depth of Cover,” and 
“One-Call Ticket” factors all change value.

Observing the change in multiple risk factors along the pipeline route can suggest locations where 
preventive measures and mitigative measures to reduce risk could be most effective.  Figure VII-2 
depicts an example of a “risk alignment sheet,” where changing risk model outputs along a pipeline 
route are shown in a visual form.  As risk factor data changes and is used to generate estimates of 
likelihood, consequences, and risk, these outputs fluctuate.

Figure VII-2 
Sample “Risk Alignment Sheet” 
The most important reasons to choose specific risk model types include: 1) how the models 
relate to and represent the pipeline system, 2) the output risk measures provided by each 
model type, and 3) the capabilities of model types to support decision making (see section III.A).  
While the type and quality of data that are available as model inputs are discriminating factors 
for applying different types of models, they should not be the primary factor.  All model types 
can employ a combination of location-specific data from records, industry or operator averages, 
and SME-sourced information.  PHMSA does not believe that any specific model type is 
preferable simply based on the level of data quality available to support the model inputs. 
However, it should be acknowledged that the accuracy of a specific model is relative to data 
quality.  All models are dependent on data quality and it is important that data quality be 
addressed consistent with improving the accuracy of model results. 
A quantitative system model, if it represents the logical and physical combination of risk factors 
to produce likelihood and consequences, can produce useful results even if uncertainties exist in 
the input data.  Although optimal results are obtained with a high degree of accurate location
specific data, system risk insights and support for decisions can be achieved with different levels 
February 1, 2020 
65 
February 1, 2020  
of data quality and completeness, including situations when significant reliance is placed on SME 
input or generic data. 
Operator records of segment-specific characteristics are the primary source of data used for risk 
model inputs.  Operators collect data from routine operating, maintenance, and inspection 
activities.  For example, operating logs record pressures, indicative of stresses on the pipeline, 
and transients to which the pipeline may be subjected.  Exposed pipe reports record data about 
the condition of the pipeline that is gathered whenever the pipeline is exposed by excavation for 
other reasons.  Records of patrols and surveillance show nearby construction activities that 
could pose threats to the pipeline, and evidence of changes in local flora that may be indicative 
of changes in soil conditions.  Data sets from in-line inspection integrity assessments also 
provide information about pipeline integrity. 
Operators should ensure that their data acquisition forms are collecting the data needed for 
their risk model inputs.  Construction, operations, maintenance, and inspection personnel 
responsible for completing data acquisition forms should be trained on requirements for 
completing forms with the needed data quality and completeness. 
Table VII-1 lists typical data elements that apply to risk model inputs.  Table VII-2 lists important 
sources for these data elements.  Both tables were duplicated from ASME B31.8S (in some 
operating environments, operators may need to add additional data elements).  Further 
information on data sources for risk model inputs may be found in ASME B31.8S, section 4.3.

Merging large amounts of data from diverse sources is facilitated by a consistent structure for 
storing and retrieving the data.  As an example, the pipeline industry has developed the 
“Pipeline Open Data Standard” (PODS) database architecture as a structure for organizing 
pipeline data (see http://www.pods.org).  Figure VII-3 depicts the top-level structure of PODS.  
Figure VIII-463 shows an example of the data structure for a PODS module, showing the structure 
for data items such as CP type, CP Criteria, Nominal Wall Thickness, Outside Diameter, Pipe 
Grade, and Pipe Long Seam.  The full scope of PODS modules may be found at

It is important to evaluate the quality of the current data supplied to a risk model.  For many 
pipeline risk models, improving the scope and quality of input data is a long-term process.  The 
operator should understand the overall characteristics of the risk model data set and implement 
actions to ensure needed data quality and seek continuous improvement in the data gathered 
and input to the model.  Risk model data quality issues can increase uncertainty in the results 
from the model.  If the results are used to support decision making, then the results should be 
interpreted in light of those uncertainties. 
February 1, 2020  
There are many ways to measure data quality,64 but, in the context of risk models, two central 
aspects can be identified:  
1. Data Completeness 
For any model, there may be input variables that are not always known, or not 
verified to be accurate.  Often in these cases, generic default values based on 
general industry information or SME knowledge and experience are applied.  
Accounting for this, a simple measure of data quality is the “unavailability” of 
pipeline-specific data in situations where default or generic average values are being 
used.  This data quality measure can be further refined by considering the relative 
importance of the respective input data elements according to their impact on the 
risk model results. 
The lack of pipeline-specific data does not imply that certain model types should not 
be used and the results should not be applied to support decisions.  If a model is 
thought to be a better representation of the pipeline system but input data is 
incomplete, then informed default inputs can be used as an interim step, and data 
needs can be prioritized as familiarity with the model, model results, and real-world 
application to pipeline integrity management develop.   
If a probabilistic model is being used, priorities for additional data collection may be 
developed systematically using a value-of-information analysis.  This analysis 
estimates how additional data collection is expected to affect risk assessment 
results and thereby potentially change decisions on risk reducing measures.  If the 
analysis finds that collecting specific additional information could change decisions 
significantly, then risk reduction could be significantly enhanced by collecting the 
additional information.  To ensure complete and accurate data for risk model, 
operators should ensure that records are preserved and retrievable. 
2. Data uncertainty 
In addition to data completeness, it is also important to understand the uncertainty 
in data inputs to a model, regardless of the modeling approach.  It is straightforward 
to estimate the basic statistical attributes for each model input (e.g., mean, 
variance).  Bayesian updating65 (a technique where a set of existing information – 
e.g., industry level component failure rate – can be updated by additional pipeline
specific data) is one approach to providing updated statistical estimates as 
64  For example, see “Dimensions of Data Quality: Toward Quality Data by Design”; Wang, Guarascio (1991) 
(http://web.mit.edu/smadnick/www/wp2/1991-06.pdf), cited in presentation by P. Westrick, Using Data in 
Relative models with Respect to Decision Criteria, March 8, 2017. 
65  See Probabilistic Risk Assessment Procedures Guide for Offshore Applications (DRAFT), BSEE-2016-xxx (Draft), 
October 25, 2016, and presentation by R. Youngblood, Idaho National Laboratory, Bayesian analysis approaches 
to risk modeling, August 9, 2016 (https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/docs/technical

additional data for a variable are obtained.  Applying methods to estimate input 
variable uncertainty is especially important for risk models that apply only point 
estimates as input values rather than probability distributions.  Applying a point 
estimate to represent a variable’s underlying data is convenient, but if the data is 
spread over a wide range, this should be understood and handled in a deliberate 
manner (e.g., sensitivity analysis).  This is particularly important for the input 
variables that have the largest effect on model results. 
If SME input is used, then the uncertainty associated with this input should be 
understood, particularly for the most important input variables.  Applying point 
values for SME-based input variables with little attention to the uncertainty in those 
inputs can introduce substantial bias into risk results. 
A persistent issue often mentioned by pipeline operators is data loss during new construction 
and during asset acquisition.  To ensure complete and accurate data for risk model, operators 
should ensure that records are preserved and retreivable after construction and acquistion 
events. 
Accurate records of pipeline characteristics (including operational, maintenance, and inspection 
history) and the geographic features in the pipeline vicinity should be the primary source of risk 
model inputs.  However, complete and accurate records are not always available for every pipe 
segment, and some risk model inputs may not be obtainable from records.  In some cases, 
operator or industry average values may be available as inputs where segment-specific data are 
not available.  In other cases, operators are dependent on the knowledge and experience of 
personnel who are familiar with the pipeline and important risk factors.  Although accurate data 
from records may be a preferable source, SMEs are a valuable source for significant portions of 
the information used as risk model inputs.   
For greatest effectiveness, a structured process is needed to integrate and balance personnel 
knowledge on risk factors to ensure consistency and minimize bias.  Steps in the process may 
resemble:66 
1. Establish members of the SME group that will provide data estimates. 
Each SME should be an actual “expert,” in that the individual has authoritative or 
unique knowledge on the risk factors being evaluated.  Criteria for SME status 
include factors such as credentials demonstrating expertise (not just years in a job 
or longevity at a company), certificates and training records, industry recognition, 
professional/ongoing education, etc. 
66  The basic steps given here are adapted from Ayyub, B., A Practical Guide on Conducting Expert Elicitation of 
Probabilities and Consequences for Corps Facilities, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, IWR Report 01-R-01, 2001. 
72

2. Identify SME group facilitator and information integrator. 
The facilitator should be familiar with the risk model, know how to interpret and 
calibrate expert opinion accounting for individual biases, and know how to integrate 
the information to obtain useful inputs for the risk model.   
3. Define each variable or model input that is being estimated by expert opinion. 
All quantities should be precisely defined so that the experts clearly understand the 
scope and boundaries of what is being estimated.  All relevant records and maps 
should be available to the SME group to help clarify the variable definitions and 
guide the evaluations. 
4. Define specific criteria for SME evaluation of variables. 
Specific rules should be established for how SMEs assign input values to ensure 
consistent application by different SMEs and consistent application across all 
pipeline segments covered by the risk model.  For example, if “external coating 
condition” is being evaluated on a segment, then SMEs need specific criteria for 
what constitutes “good,” “medium,” “poor,” “disbonded,” or “shielding” coating 
conditions, so that the process can be consistently applied across the operator’s 
pipeline assets.  Quantitative criteria are preferable where practicable. 
5. Elicit SME information to obtain values for variables. 
The process should involve a facilitated discussion to elicit risk factor inputs from 
the SME group.  The facilitator should train the SMEs on the objectives of the 
evaluation, the process for eliciting SME input, and the evaluation criteria.   
Group discussion should be facilitated and opinions obtained and made available to 
the entire SME group for consideration before a conclusion is reached.  Although 
knowledgeable, SMEs can still have biases that influence their estimates of 
variables.  A discussion should endeavor to draw out any biases67 and correct for 
them.  Any available applicable data (including information on pipeline 
characteristics, operational history, or inspection history) that can be used for 
comparisons is useful for this purpose. 
6. Aggregate and present results. 
The SME evaluations should be assessed for internal consistency and aggregated.  
The process should have documented rules for handling differences of opinion 
among SMEs68 and methods for evaluating uncertainties in the inputs that are based 
67  Muhlbauer, W., Pipeline Risk Management Manual, 2004, Table 1.2, for a list of biases that can affect expert 
evaluations. See also Ayyub, 2001, Appendix C.

Facilities, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, IWR Report 01-R-01, 2001.  Different methods for combining expert 
opinions are summarized in Appendix C of Ayyub, 2001. 
73

on SME information.  SME input should always include measures of uncertainty that 
capture the range of possible values estimated by the expert for each variable and 
the relative weighting of the values in the range.  Probability distributions are a 
convenient way to capture information on uncertainty and can be used as direct 
input to probabilistic risk models.  One method for expert elicitation69 involves 
assembling the evidence that each expert has used to formulate estimates, and 
deriving probability distributions for each variable consistent with that evidence. 
7. Review and revise results. 
The aggregated results should be presented to the SMEs for review, additional 
discussion, and potential revision.  SMEs should be given the opportunity to revise 
their assessments after presented with the aggregated evaluation results.  Any 
revised estimates should be incorporated in the aggregated results and Step 6 
repeated.

• An operator’s choice for the type of risk model to employ in pipeline risk analysis 
should not primarily depend on factors related to quality and completeness of input 
data.  Operators should take actions to improve data quality and completeness over 
time, but risk model inputs should represent the best currently available 
information on risk factors for each pipeline segment and operators should 
endeavor to employ segment-specific and location-specific data whenever possible 
to develop risk model inputs.   
• Field data acquisition forms should be consistently checked against the data needs 
in the risk assessment and the GIS processes to assure the data that is needed to 
support these processes is being collected in the formats and quality expected.  
Personnel responsible for completing data acquisition forms should be trained on 
requirements for completing forms with the needed data quality and completeness.

• Risk models that rely on generic estimates or SME information for a significant 
portion of input data can be useful to gain insight on risk issues and support 
decisions.  This is especially so if the model algorithm reflects the physical and 
logical relationships of the input variables and the model output risk measures are 
expressed in standard units. 
• Risk model results should be generated using dynamic segmentation to account for 
changes in characteristics of the pipeline and its operating environment along the 
pipeline route, so that the results best reflect the segment-specific and location
specific combinations of risk factors. 
• SME input should be elicited carefully to best reflect expert knowledge on risk 
factors.  A structured process should be employed to systematically obtain 
estimates from SMEs.  All SME estimates should include a measure of the 
uncertainty in the estimates and effort should be made to minimize bias in the 
estimates.

Appendices 
Appendix A – Likelihood Models 
In qualitative models, inputs and outputs are developed as qualitative categories rather than 
numerical scores.  In processes that use such models, the likelihood, consequence, and output 
risk levels are obtained by consideration of pipeline risk factors and assignment to a qualitative 
risk level.  These models should have a defined logic for assigning risk levels.   
Risk levels may be assigned via an SME discussion.  If so, a structured process is needed to 
integrate and balance the panel’s knowledge on risk factors (see section VII.D).   
A simplified example of the representation of qualitative results is given in Figure A-1.  In the 
matrix shown, the different shaded regions represent areas of equivalent risk based on different 
combinations of likelihood and consequence.

Relative Assessment (index) model inputs represent the major risk factors for failure of a 
pipeline segment, including characteristics of pipeline segments and the surrounding area.  
These inputs are assigned numeric scores that represent the relative effects on failure likelihood 
of a pipeline characteristic.  Each input may also be assigned a numerical weight, which reflects 
a subjective assessment of the importance to the potential for a pipeline failure represented by 
the input.  The weighted scores are then combined to calculate an index or score representing 
the risk presented by each segment.  Weights are commonly applied to threat scores to account 
for the pipeline segment’s or operator’s failure cause history.  Typically, a likelihood index score 
and consequence index score are calculated separately.  They are then combined to obtain a 
total risk index score.  The most common method of combining a likelihood and consequence 
index to calculate a risk score is by multiplying them. 
The index model algorithms often combine likelihood factors according to categories 
representing major threats to pipeline integrity.  For example, index model likelihood categories 
might include: 
• External Corrosion 
• Internal Corrosion 
• Stress Corrosion Cracking 
• Manufacturing Related Defects 
o Defective pipe seam 
o Defective pipe 
• Welding/Fabrication Related 
o Defective pipe girth weld 
o Defective fabrication weld 
o Wrinkle bend or buckle 
o Stripped threads/broken pipe/coupling 
o Failure 
• Equipment 
o Gasket O-ring failure 
o Control/Relief equipment malfunction 
o Seal/pump packing failure 
o Miscellaneous 
• Third Party/Mechanical Damage 
o Damage inflicted by first, second, or third parties 
(instantaneous/immediate failure) 
o Previously damaged pipe (delayed failure mode) 
o Vandalism 
• Incorrect Operations 
77

o Incorrect operational procedure 
• Weather Related and Outside Force 
o Cold weather 
o Lightning 
o Heavy rains or floods 
o Earth Movements 
The models typically include several inputs in each threat category.  As noted above, each input 
is assigned a numerical score based on the characteristics or “attributes” of the pipeline 
segment or the area surrounding the section and is weighted according to its importance.  The 
attribute information is stored in a pipeline risk database.  Individual likelihood and 
consequence indexes can be calculated for each threat, using only the scores and weights of 
inputs included for the threat category. 
For example, a risk index algorithm used by one pipeline operator includes the input 
“Construction Activity” under the category of “Third-Party Damage.”  This input has four 
possible levels, or “attributes,” corresponding to different levels of construction activity along a 
pipeline segment.  A numerical score is associated with each attribute so that the variable can 
be assessed on a consistent basis from pipeline segment to pipeline segment.  The attributes 
and their associated scores for “Construction Activity” are as follows: 
Construction Activity 
Attribute 
High 
Score 
10 
Medium 
7 
Low (“typical”) 
Very Low or None 
5 
1 
Specific rules should be established for assigning attributes to ensure consistent application of 
the process across different SME groups.  SMEs need specific guidance on what constitutes 
“high,” “medium,” “low,” and “very low,” so that the process can be consistently applied across 
the operator’s pipeline assets. 
Continuing the example, the weight for “Construction Activity” within the third-party damage 
threat category would be assigned a value (e.g., perhaps “13%”).  In this algorithm, the attribute 
score for the “Construction Activity” variable is multiplied by this weight and summed with the 
weighted attribute scores for all other inputs in the third-party damage category to calculate a 
likelihood index score for the relative probability of pipeline damage due to third-party damage.  
This threat-specific index score is weighted and summed with the weighted index scores 
developed for the other cause categories to obtain the total likelihood index.  The likelihood 
index is multiplied by the consequence index to obtain the total risk score for the pipeline 
segment.

Some operators use one of the “standard” risk-index models that have been developed by 
various industry consultants, while other operators have developed their own in-house index 
models.  One commonly used industry model is the model, presented in the Muhlbauer Pipeline 
Risk Management Manual.70   
Significant differences exist among index models in the specific input variables that are included 
in the quantification of the likelihood index, how scores are assigned to these variables, how the 
scores are weighted, and how the weighted scores are combined to provide an overall index.  In 
the most common approach, the likelihood index is calculated simply as a weighted sum of the 
variable scores.  Each variable weight is multiplied by the corresponding variable score for a 
segment and the products of the variable weights and scores are summed to calculate the 
likelihood index.  If any interacting threats were applicable, an additional score would be added 
to the likelihood index to reflect the additional likelihood of pipeline failure (i.e., the “Pi = failure 
probability from threat 1 and threat 2 interactions” discussed in Section IV.E). 
In the Muhlbauer71 approach, an index model algorithm calculates the likelihood index as a 
weighted sum of variable scores.  The Muhlbauer Pipeline Risk Management Manual provides a 
set of nominal variable scores and weights that are intended to be starting points for the 
incorporation of segment-specific data.  Additional variables can be defined by the operator. 
In-house models developed by operators have been similar in nature to these two models.  In 
some models, the algorithm that translates the individual variable scores into the likelihood 
index is more complex than a simple weighted sum. 
A fundamental characteristic of index models is that the quantitative output is not an actual 
estimate of the likelihood of failure, consequence of failure, or risk.  Instead, it is a numerical 
index that represents these measures.  In most cases, a higher index value is meant to indicate 
higher likelihood, consequence, or risk and a lower index value is meant to indicate lower 
values.  Thus, the indexes provide a relative measure of risk that has been useful for comparison 
between different segments or sections of the pipeline (e.g., for setting integrity assessment 
priorities).  Relative model risk results can be challenging to use for applications requiring 
absolute estimates of likelihood or risk. 
In this category of risk model, the characteristics of segments of the pipeline and the 
surrounding area are used to derive an actual estimate of the risk for each segment.  Likelihood 
is estimated as the frequency of failure along each segment over a year’s time (or over some 
other relevant period).  Expected levels of consequences in different categories (e.g., human 
health and safety, the environment, or the potential for economic losses) are estimated.  The 
various consequence measures may be combined using some common units, such as equivalent 
70  Muhlbauer, W. Kent, Pipeline Risk Management Manual, 2004.

dollar cost.  If so, this requires consequences such as human deaths and injuries and adverse 
environmental impacts to be represented by dollars in the risk equation.   
The total risk for the segment is estimated as the product of the likelihood of failure and the 
expected consequences given failure.  If the model calculates the likelihood of different pipeline 
failure modes (i.e., small leak, large leak, rupture), then the likelihood and consequences 
corresponding to each failure mode would be estimated as well.  The total risk would be 
estimated as the sum of the product of the likelihood of failure in each failure mode and the 
expected consequences, given failure in that mode. 
Quantitative System models calculate the likelihood and consequences of a failure along each 
pipeline segment using the same general types of information on pipeline segment 
characteristics and the surrounding area that relative assessment (index) models use.  Like index 
models, they can use a combination of data and SME judgment to evaluate inputs in categories 
corresponding to important threats and consequences. 
The algorithm for a Quantitative System model typically includes numerous calculations based 
on the physical and logical relationships that translate pipeline segment characteristics into 
estimates of failure likelihood and consequences. 
In one model of this type, a nominal or base likelihood estimate is provided based on historical 
failure rates for the cause categories.  This nominal failure rate is modified according to 
segment-specific characteristics to estimate a segment-specific failure rate (i.e., the expected 
number of failures for each of the different failure modes per year).  The algorithm for 
modification of the base failure rate may be based on statistical analysis of incident data or on 
analytical models (e.g., fault tree models or structural reliability models).  In addition, the 
estimate for likelihood of failure may be modified by assumptions about the inspection and 
maintenance history and practice along the segment.  For example, segments that have had 
recent integrity assessment and repair of discovered defects would typically have different 
failure likelihood estimates than other segments whose characteristics would otherwise be 
similar.  In addition, as shown in previous Figure IV-3, the additional threat potential from 
interacting threats can be explicitly accounted for in quantitative system and probabilistic 
models. 
As an example of how an analytical tool is utilized to estimate the likelihood of pipeline failure 
for one threat category, see Figure A-2, which is a simplified fault tree that models the likelihood 
of an excavator hit on a pipeline.  This model would be part of the model used to estimate the 
likelihood of failure from excavation damage. 
80

February 1, 2020  
Figure A-2 
Simplified Example Fault Tree Model for Excavator to Hit Pipeline72 
The frequencies or probabilities of the basic events of this fault tree (construction activity, 
inadequate cover, etc.) are model inputs that would be evaluated based on data or SME inputs.  
These quantities would be combined according to the model logic to estimate the probability of 
a pipeline hit by an excavator.  This estimate would be combined with an estimate of pipe 
failure probability, given a hit, to obtain the estimated failure likelihood due to excavation 
damage.  The failure probability, given a hit, is estimated using the probability of a hit imposing 
specific loads on the pipe and the probability of pipe failure to maintain integrity given those 
loads (based on pipe characteristics). 
For time-dependent threats (e.g., corrosion), a similar “load vs. resistance” approach may be 
taken that includes evaluation of operating pressure, pipe properties, identified defect 
characteristics, and the likelihood of failure given pipe, defect, and operating characteristics.  
For these threats, however, defects grow over time, so the likelihood of failure is time 
dependent. 
Consequences in some risk estimation models are estimated using analytical models to derive 
quantities such as economic loss and fatalities. 
The CFER PIRAMID model is an example of a risk estimation model that has been employed by 
some pipeline operators. 
Because Quantitative System model outputs are actual estimates of probability, consequences, 
and risk in standard units, they may potentially be applied appropriately to IM program areas

requiring absolute measures of risk, as well as when relative measures are needed.  They may 
also be used in other applications that require absolute quantitative estimates of risk. 
Probabilistic models are distinguished from other quantitative system models by the use of 
probability distributions, rather than single point value estimates, to represent model inputs.  
The model algorithms combine the distributions according to the system model and obtain 
output distributions for standard risk measures such as probability of failure, and expected loss 
from consequences.  The difference between a Quantitative System model and a Probabilistic 
model is not necessarily in the logic of the model algorithm, but a probabilistic model should 
utilize tools (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation73) that allow probabilistic input, in the form of 
distributions, to be processed and derive output distributions.   
Some important inputs to pipeline risk models, such as integrity assessment results and 
consequences to receptors, can be highly uncertain.  Allowing probabilistic input is an advantage 
when the input values are uncertain, so that the model output can reflect the input 
uncertainties.  The output risk measures then give a fuller representation of the range of 
possible values, including potential high-consequence outcomes. 
Figure A-374 depicts an example of distributions to represent uncertainties for inputs to a model 
for the time-dependent probability of failure due to corrosion.  Uncertain inputs that are 
assigned distributions include operating pressure, pipe yield strength and toughness, defect 
characteristics from ILI, and defect growth.  The model calculates a failure probability as a 
function of time, given these distributions. 
Input distributions should be chosen by considering the range of possible values for the inputs 
and how the possible values are distributed over the range.  Statistical methods, such as 
Bayesian analysis, may be used to choose distributions given data or SME estimates for an input.

Example of Use of FN Curves and “ALARP” by a Gas Pipeline Quantitative Risk Model 
One scheme that has been used in application of the PipeSafe75 quantitative risk model for a 
natural gas pipeline operator is a combination of the ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) 
principal with three societal risk bands on a frequency vs. number of fatalities (“FN”) scale.76 
Three risk bands for societal risk are defined to determine the relative value of measures to 
reduce risk at a location on the pipelines: 
• At the top end of the scale there are risks that judged to be so great that they are not 
acceptable/tolerable.  [Region above the red line in Figures B-1 and B-2.] 
• At the bottom end are situations where the risk is, or has been made, so small that no 
further precaution is necessary – a ‘broadly acceptable’ region.  [Region between the 
red line and blue line in Figures B-1 and B-2.] 
• In between these two extremes is a region where risks are tolerable only if their level 
has been reduced to one that is ALARP (As Low as Reasonably Practicable).  [Region 
below the blue line in Figures B-1 and B-2.] 
See the Figure B-1 below for an illustration of an FN curve representing the societal risk of 
fatalities at a specific location on the pipeline.  In this example, a portion of the risk curve is in 
the “ALARP” region, so risk reduction measures were sought to reduce risk at the location. 
Figure B-2 shows FN curves for proposed preventive measures for the location with the risk 
illustrated in Figure B-1.  Multiple risk-reducing measures are shown to move the entire FN 
curve into the “broadly acceptable” risk band.

1. A different upper limit is used to define the border between the intolerable risk 
region and the “ALARP” region. 
2. There is no “broadly tolerable” risk region where risk is considered low enough 
so that ALARP criteria are not applied. 
3. There is a separate region at the lower right end of the FN graph to indicate low 
probability, high consequence outcomes.  Risks in this area are noted for special

Example: Relative Risk Model Consequence Model 
A risk index model, developed by Dynamic Risk,77 and used by an operator for pipelines with 
diverse hazardous liquid commodities, calculates hazard areas for multiple hazards posed by a 
potential pipeline failure: 
• Flammability  
• Toxicity (based on H2S content) 
• Overpressure 
For flammability and toxicity, the size of the hazard area is based on equations from API RP 581 
for different commodities, considering estimated release rates, likelihood of ignition, liquid or 
gas release, and instantaneous or continuous release.  For overpressure, the hazard area 
calculations use estimated release rates and “…TNT equivalent Equation for Hard radius...”78 
Estimated release rates are based on an average of assumed hole sizes assumed for failure from 
different threats and equations for sonic and subsonic flow. 
The largest hazard area of the three hazards considered for each location is chosen to estimate 
consequences.  Human safety consequences are derived from the product of the estimated 
hazard area and the assumed population density within the hazard area (units are the estimated 
number of persons impacted).  Different population densities are assumed based on which HCA 
types (High-Population, Other Populated, No HCAs, etc.) are within the hazard area.   
Environmental consequences are estimated as the cost to clean up spills, which is considered 
applicable to commodities released as liquids (including some HVLs).  Different costs per gallon 
to clean up spill are assumed for liquids and HVLs and for different HCA types.  Total costs are 
estimated by applying this cost per gallon to the estimated spill volume, which is based on leak 
detection and shut down time, volume in line between valves, and drain down factor.  The units 
are estimated total clean-up costs in dollars. 
The human safety impact measured in estimated number of persons impacted and 
environmental impact measured in estimated total clean-up costs are weighted to obtain a total 
consequence score (Figure B-4 below).  Note that safety and environmental consequence scores 
are assigned the same weight in the overall consequence score and economic consequences are 
assigned zero weight.

Appendix D – Migration from Older Risk Analysis Methods to Quantitative 
Models 
This appendix discusses an example “risk model type” conversion of a scoring-type pipeline risk 
assessment into a quantitative model that better quantifies risks.  The benefits of such an upgrade are 
numerous, as is discussed in Section III.A. 
This model type conversion process is intended to salvage and utilize previously-collected data wherever 
practical.  When the underlying scoring assessment is robust, only a few data sources will need to be 
added to supplement the existing data used in a scoring type risk assessment. 
This conversion process involves four general steps: 
1. Convert data currently expressed as scores into data with verifiable measurement units, 
2. Establish risk estimation equations that utilize this measurement data, 
3. Produce risk assessment results using the converted data and the appropriate algorithms, and 
4. Perform QA/QC on results. 
This information applies to risk assessments performed on components or collections of components of 
a pipeline system.  Components include line pipe, fittings, valves, appurtenances, tanks, pumps, 
compressors, etc.  Collections of components includes typical groupings such as all types of pipeline 
systems (gathering, transmission, distribution, offshore, onshore, etc.), and all types of facilities (tank 
farms, pump or compressor stations, etc.), or to specific components such as tanks, pumps, and 
compressors when such equipment are assessed based on their sub-components. 
Performing the basic conversion process will take a varying level of effort, depending on factors such as 
those shown below.  However, experience has shown that the level of effort is not as significant as some 
may think, and the benefits to safety and reduced consequences of a failure have been shown to 
significantly outweigh the costs. 
• Knowledge and skills of personnel performing upgrade 
o General pipeline knowledge 
o Risk knowledge 
o Software skills 
• Data previously collected for previous risk assessments 
o Data quantity 
o Data condition

▪ Correctly aligned to common centerlines 
▪ Consistent formatting 
▪ Level of modifications previously done for scoring purposes 
• Level of QA/QC performed 
The data conversion portion of the upgrade will often require the majority of the effort.  Performing the 
subsequent QA/QC on the assessment results will require on going attention, with more effort at initial 
stages as practitioners become accustomed to the upgrades. 
The following definitions are offered to clarify how the terms are used specifically in this appendix. 
Algorithm:  An equation that calculates some aspect of risk for a component of a pipeline system.  
Calculation are typically done using location-specific input data describing characteristics and conditions. 
CoF:  Consequence of failure.  Multiple CoF scenarios are generally possible for each failure event. 
Exposure, Mitigation, Resistance:  These are essential components of a calculation of PoF for each 
potential failure mechanism.  Synonyms for these terms are, respectively, attack, defense, and 
survivability.  They measure: 
• Exposure or attack:  A measure of the aggressiveness of each failure mechanism, either 1) the 
frequency of integrity-threatening events or 2) the degradation rate associated with a time
dependent failure mechanism (corrosion or cracking). 
• Mitigation:  A measure of the effectiveness of all mitigation measures that serve as barriers, 
preventing or reducing the effect of the exposure. 
• Resistance:  A measure of the ability of the component to absorb the exposure without failing. 
Mpy:  Mills-per-year of pipeline degradation. 
PoD (or FoD):  Probability of Damage (or Frequency of Damage).  A part of the PoF estimate that shows 
the likelihood of a component being damaged by a failure mechanism. 
PoF (or FoF):  For purposes of this appendix, failure means loss of integrity; i.e., a leak or rupture.   
PXX:  A point in a distribution of possible values, where the distribution takes into account uncertainty. 
QRA:  Quantitative Risk Analysis. 
Receptor:  Anything that can be harmed – receive damage – from a spill/release.  Examples include 
people, property, soil, groundwater, etc. 
Risk, Expected Loss (EL):  An estimate of the damages or losses associated with possible failure-and
consequence pairings on a component or collection of components (e.g., a pipeline system) over a 
specific time period.  Typically, Risk = PoF x CoF.   
94 
February 1, 2020 
February 1, 2020  
Time to Failure (TTF):  An estimate of remaining life, based on a definition of ‘failure’, obtained by 
algorithm calculation performed on input data.  For purposes of this appendix, ‘failure’ means loss of 
integrity (i.e., a leak or rupture).  Considerations for either a leak or a rupture are included in the TTF 
value, with the one resulting in earlier failure normally dominating the final estimate of TTF. 
In order to overcome many of the limitations of scoring type assessments, and to better understand and 
communicate risks, all input data and subsequent risk assessment results should be expressed in 
verifiable measurement units.   
Verifiable measurement data is always expressed in common units of measurement.  Data is obtained 
by either direct measurement or by estimation.  These values are distinct from assigned values such as 
points or scores since they can be replicated without the need of a translation tool (e.g., a scoring, 
indexing, or point factor assignment system).   
Ensuring a consistent and appropriate set of verifiable measurement units is simply ensuring that the 
measurement units of all inputs combine algebraically to arrive at the desired risk estimate units of 
measurement. 
Examples of typical input data with verifiable and non-verifiable units of measure, include:  
Risk Issue Measured 
Measurement/Verifiable Example 
Units 
Not Deemed Verifiable Units 
Pipe specification 
Inches diameter, psi pressure, psi 
allowable stress 
The frequency of excavator 
damage potential at a specific 
location 
Excavations per mile-year 
Diameter = “large” 
Stress level = 7 risk points 
Excavator activity level = ‘high’ = 9 
risk points 
Soil Corrosivity 
Mills-per-year pitting corrosion 
rate 
Benefits of additional depth of 
cover 
“medium” = 4 risk points 
% reduction in excavator contact 
events 
CoF -11 risk points 
$ / incident, fatalities / failure 
‘low’ = 2 on risk matrix 
There are multiple measurement units that can support the CoF estimates.  The units used for input 
data will be determined by the desired units in which the final CoF will be expressed.  Whichever set of 
units are chosen, the algebra used to combine the information (see algorithm discussion below) should 
result in the desired units of CoF.  For example, if units of dollars per failure are sought, units of measure 
might be: 
CoF = hazard zone x receptors x damage rate = (ft2 of hazard zone generated per failure) x (number of 
receptors per ft2) x (damage rate per receptor, $ / receptor) = Dollars per failure 
95 
February 1, 2020 
February 1, 2020  
In this example, simply adding an estimate of ‘failures per year’ to this chain of calculations results in risk 
units of ‘dollars per year’: 
Risk = EL = PoF x CoF = (failures/year) x ($/failure) = $ / year of expected loss81 
Since all data input into the risk assessment carry verifiable measurement units, the risk assessment 
results also are expressed in verifiable measurement units.  For instance, units of events per year, events 
per mile-year, dollars per incident, TTF, expected loss per mile year, etc. are all verifiable and 
appropriate outputs for a QRA, as shown below. 
Risk, Expected Loss (EL): 
Typically, Risk = PoF x CoF.  Common units of measure include dollars per year, fatalities per mile-year, 
and overlap units used in PoF when the consequence is defined as the failure, as was defined for PoF.  
For example, failures per mile-year can be a measurement unit for both FoF and Risk.82  When risks are 
fully monetized, risk can be expressed as EL where EL ($/ year) = PoF (failures/year) x CoF ($/failure) 
PoF (or FoF): 
Common measurement units include: chance of failure per year, failures per year, failures per mile-year, 
incidents per year, ruptures per mile-year, etc.  For time-degradation failure mechanisms, TTF in units of 
time (often ‘years’) is an intermediate calculation of the PoF estimation. 
PoF Components: 
Only two sets of units are needed to describe all possible failure mechanisms.  When time-independent 
failure mechanisms are involved, units are, for example: 
PoF (failures/year) = Exposure (number of potential failure-causing events/year) x Mitigation (fraction of 
potential failure-causing events that are not avoided) x Resistance (fraction of potential failure-causing 
events failure) 
When time-dependent failure mechanisms are involved, units are, for example: 
PoF (failures/year) = f[TTF (years to failure)] where TTF (years to failure) = Resistance (inches of effective 
wall thickness) / [Exposure (mpy) x Mitigation (fraction of exposure not mitigated)] 
Alternate measurement units are also possible.  The user should ensure that, algebraically, the units 
combine to result in the units of the final risk value being estimated.  See overall examples in 
Attachment A for numerical examples using these units of measure. 
81  This example uses $/year for expected loss. Other risk units could also be utilized. 
82  However, this does not acknowledge the differences in consequences associated with various types of failures. 
96 
February 1, 2020 
February 1, 2020  
CoF:  
Common measurement units include: dollars of loss per incident, fatalities per incident, dollars per 
failure, dollars per leak, dollars per rupture, consequence units per failure, etc. 
Weightings introduce inappropriate bias into a risk assessment and are to be avoided.  The use of 
verifiable measurement data will automatically address all concerns that were previously attempted to 
be addressed by using weightings, thereby negating the need for weightings of any kind in a modern risk 
assessment.   
When upgrading a previous risk assessment that used weightings, the intent of those weightings should 
be understood.  The intent of weightings was typically to compensate for limited mathematical 
capabilities of the scoring models (e.g., limited range of possible point values with inability to capture 
real world orders of magnitude differences).  If the intent is valid, then the intended effect of the 
weighting should automatically be captured either in the conversion of the previously collected data or 
in the set-up of algorithms.  A QA/QC process should be established to confirm this. 
Every risk assessment representing real world phenomena will have at least some amount of 
uncertainty.  This is due to natural variability in all phenomena, the probabilistic nature of the real 
world, and simple lack of complete information.  Consideration of uncertainty results in a range of 
possible answers.  Every risk assessment should document how it is taking uncertainty into account. 
There are several ways to deal with this uncertainty in a risk assessment.  A rigorous option is to 
generate a distribution of possible values for each input, including considerations for both lack of 
information and ‘natural’ variation in each input.  All input distributions are then combined using the 
risk assessment algorithms.  This generates distributions of all calculation results and ensures that 
uncertainty is accounted for in final risk estimates.  Practitioners pursuing this option should seek 
background and information from the fields of statistics, engineering, and pipeline-specific materials 
science, design, operations, and maintenance practices. 
A less rigorous, but usually sufficient approach is discussed here.83  Since an understanding of the range 
of possible answers is sought, treating uncertainty in terms of conservatism is an efficient option to 
avoid the complexities of combining numerous distributions.  A risk assessment can document its 
consideration of uncertainty by declaring the target level of conservatism used in producing its risk 
estimates.  For regulatory compliance as well as practical utility, the recommendation is to not exclude 
input values that are thought to be “rare,” thereby erring on the side of overstating the actual risks.  By 
instead including all input values and specifying their perceived rarity used in the assessment, the role of 
83  While this discussed approach requires at least an approximation of the range and frequency of possible values 
(a distribution), similar to the more rigorous option, that distribution can often be simply approximated rather 
than be derived from rigorous analyses. 
97 
February 1, 2020 
February 1, 2020  
uncertainty is acknowledged and the entire range of risk is more readily understood.  This “range of risk” 
concept is important for decision makers to understand when managing pipeline integrity. 
“PXX” terminology, taken from probability theory, can be used to convey the way in which 
uncertainty/conservatism is being handled in a specific risk assessment.  PXX refers to a point in a 
distribution of possible values, where the distribution takes into account uncertainty.  The values 
assigned for various conservatism levels – i.e., PXX levels – arise from a known or posited distribution of 
all possible actual values.   
A higher PXX means more conservatism – tending to overstate actual risk – is being incorporated into 
the risk assessment.  P50 normally means the value most likely to occur84 is being used, so zero 
conservatism accompanies this value.  P90 means a rare value, erring on the side of overstating actual 
risk, is being used, thereby ensuring conservatism (tending to overstate actual risk) is being used.  
Numerically, P90 suggests that risk is being overstated 9 times out of ten – a negative surprise occurs 
once time out of ten when a P90 value is used.  A P99 value means that risk has been underestimated 
only one time out of a hundred – i.e., actual risk will be lower 99 times out of a hundred. 
Specifying the level of conservatism that is being employed in the choice of input data effectively turns 
distributions of possible values into point estimates of possible values.  Different levels of conservatism 
support different intended uses of the risk assessment.  The risk assessor declares the level of 
conservatism used in each assessment, often performing two or more assessments to show the range of 
possible results.  A common strategy is to produce risk estimates at a high (P90 or P99) level of 
conservatism, for use in location-specific risk management and also to produce a P50 risk assessment for 
use in communications with outside stakeholders.   
The objective of this phase of the upgrade is to create a new database of converted information, where 
each entry in the new database carries units of verifiable measurements.  The ‘rules’ and processes used 
to create the new database should be documented and preserved since they memorialize this aspect of 
the risk assessment upgrade. 
Since a pipeline is an engineered structure placed in an often constantly changing natural environment, 
numerous sets of data are normally required to fully assess risk.  This is true for any risk assessment 
methodology.  Therefore, previously-collected information used in a scoring type risk assessment can 
often be readily upgraded for use in a quantitative risk assessment (QRA). 
The first step is to identify data that is already captured in absolute terms – i.e., in verifiable units of 
measure.  This includes all data in measurements units such as inches, feet, psi, mills-per-year (mpy), 
counts, frequency, etc.  This data generally requires no conversion. 
Next, data whose underlying measurement units can be easily extracted from its expression as a ‘score’ 
should be returned to those units.  For example, if depth of cover of 24-inches was previously assigned a 
84  The mode of the distribution; also, the mean and median, if the distribution is ‘Normal.’ 
98 
February 1, 2020 
February 1, 2020  
value of 7 points in a scoring system, all values of ‘7’ in the old risk database should be should generate 
a record showing 24 inches in the new database.   
Data Category 
The next step is to assign each piece of input data to one of four categories, based on the risk 
information that is contained in the data. 
Examples of Data/Information 
PoF: Exposure 
excavator activity, mpy external corrosion, mpy fatigue 
cracking, human error rates, etc. 
Example Units of Measure 
events/mile-year 
PoF: Mitigation 
depth of cover, patrol, signage, coatings, procedures, 
training, etc. 
% reduction in exposure 
PoF: Resistance wall thickness, SMYS, toughness, weaknesses (dents, 
gouges, seam issues, etc.), etc. 
% of damage resisted without 
leak/rupture OR85 effective wall 
thickness (inches) 
CoF 
population density, thermal radiation distance, 
dispersion distances, explosion potential, overland 
flow distances, soil permeability, etc. 
Ft2, Count/ft2, value per unit 
(remediation costs), cost per 
incident, etc. 
This categorization adds much clarity to the risk assessment since the role of each piece of information 
is better understood and its use in the risk assessment is transparent. 
Most data will fit logically and uniquely into just one category, although it might impact several aspects 
within the category.  Some data has application in more than one category.  As an example of both, the 
input variable ‘flow rate’ can influence risk estimates of four different PoF exposures: surge potential, 
fatigue, internal corrosion, and erosion.  Flow rates also influence CoF estimates of spill size, dispersion, 
leak detection, and others. 
Some data might be more efficiently converted using a risk assessment algorithm, rather than a data 
conversion algorithm.  Recall the previous example of restoring a depth of cover ‘score’ to the actual 
depth – “score of 7 is 24 inches.”  The record showing 24-inches of cover is important.  But the risk 
assessment should also ‘understand’ the benefits of the 24-inches of cover.  This can be done either by 
storing the risk-reduction-value of 24-inches of cover in another database or by using an algorithm that 
translates 24-inches into a risk reduction value.86  The risk assessment algorithms are discussed in the 
next section.  Either option – building a separate database of values ready to be used in the risk 
assessment or equating ‘raw’ data into risk terms using an algorithm – is viable and the choice is a 
matter of preference for the model designer. 
85  Two types of units are commonly used, depending on whether the failure mechanism is time dependent 
(corrosion or cracking) or time-independent (third party damage, geohazards, etc.). 
86  Note that translating 24” of cover into a risk reduction benefit is not the same as scoring.  The understanding 
that equates 24” into a mitigation benefit is a measurement, can be verified, and has meaning beyond a relative 
comparison.  The understanding underlying this translation can arise from anywhere in a range of rigor: from a 
detailed analysis to a simple estimate provided by a knowledgeable individual.

A.D-10.1 CoF Data Sub-Categories 
As with PoF data to be used as risk assessment inputs, previously collected data for CoF will generally fall 
into one of only a few categories.  Those categories, and sample data inputs for each, are: 
1. Spill/Release size:  The volume or mass released in a failure, as a function of hole size, product 
characteristics, operational parameters (e.g., flow rates, pressures, elevation, etc.), detection 
time, reaction time. 
2. Dispersion:  The distance traveled by the spill/release, as a function of product characteristics, 
terrain, atmospheric conditions, detection time, reaction time, surface flow resistance, etc.   
3. Hazard area estimates:  The footprint or area of the leak/rupture, in which damages to one or 
more receptors may occur. 
4. Receptors:  The types and counts of receptors that are potentially damaged by a leak/rupture. 
The objective of the algorithm upgrade is to have a set of calculations the makes correct and efficient 
use of all relevant input information and produces complete and verifiable estimates of risk in terms of 
PoF, CoF, and TTF. 
Algorithms should quantify all aspects of risk at all locations along each pipeline system being assessed.  
Algorithms to calculate risk in a modern QRA should ensure that measurement units of all inputs 
combine appropriately to express risks in units that are also verifiable.  The upgrade algorithms should 
be intuitive and easily established in any calculating software platform.   
This section discusses algorithm set-up concepts. 
A.D-11.1 PoF 
Algorithms supporting a modern QRA’s PoF estimate should use or produce values for exposure, 
mitigation, and resistance, for each potential failure mechanism.  That is, each failure mechanism should 
have values assigned to exposure, mitigation, and resistance at all points along each pipeline system 
being assessed. 
Exposure, mitigation, and resistance combine to provide estimates of both PoD and PoF for each failure 
mechanism.  However, the initial step of measuring each independently is critical.  Measuring exposure 
independently generates knowledge of the ‘area of opportunity’ or the aggressiveness of the attacking 
mechanism.  Then, the separate estimate of mitigation effectiveness shows how much of that exposure 
will likely be prevented from reaching the component being assessed.  Finally, the resistance estimate 
shows how often the component will failure, if contact with the exposure occurs.   
In risk management, where decision-makers contemplate possible additional mitigation measures, 
additional resistance, or even a re-location of the component (often the only way to change the 
exposure), this knowledge of the three key factors will be critical. 
The PoF algorithms will differ slightly depending on which of the two types of failure mechanisms are 
being assessed.

February 1, 2020  
A.D-11.2 Time Independent Failure Mechanisms 
Each time independent failure mechanism, including excavation damages, impacts of any other kind, 
geohazards, human errors, sabotage, etc., that contributes to an overall PoF should have its specific PoF 
estimated.  That estimate is made from combining the three aspects of PoF as discussed previously.   
A.D-11.3 Time Dependent Failure Mechanisms 
Quantifying PoF for time-dependent failure mechanisms can be more challenging than for time
independent failure mechanisms.  The additional challenge arises from 1) the need to produce an 
intermediate estimate of TTF and 2) the need to assess the effectiveness of commonly used mitigation 
measures. 
As a modeling convenience that generally produces PoF estimates of sufficient accuracy, each time
dependent failure mechanism can be modelled in terms of: 
• Exposure expressed as mills-per-year (mpy) 
• Mitigation expressed as a probability that, at a specific location, some amount of mpy 
degradation is occurring. 
• Resistance expressed as the effective wall thickness that experiences the mpy degradation. 
These terms produce an estimate of TTF.  That estimate should then be expressed also as an equivalent 
PoF.  A simple and conservative relationship to do this could be simply: PoF = 1/TTF.  More accuracy is 
achieved when expanded relationships are used, capturing, for example, instances where failures early 
in the TTF time range are virtually impossible.   
A.D-11.4 CoF 
Consistent with the categorization of CoF input data (previously discussed), the CoF algorithms will use 
those same categories to produce estimates of direct CoF resulting from leak/rupture. 
Many sophisticated analyses routines are available to model hydrocarbon releases and potential 
thermal events associated with leaks/ruptures.  A review of these is beyond the scope of this appendix. 
Critical to the risk assessment upgrade recommended here, is the estimation of a hazard area that could 
arise from a leak/rupture.  The hazard area estimate should include considerations of spill/release size 
and duration, dispersion (travel from origination point), ignition potential, potential thermal events 
(fire/explosion), contamination/toxic effects. 
Once a hazard area has been estimated, an accounting should be made of the types, quantities, and 
sensitivities of the various receptors within the hazard area.  Receptors typically include human 
populations, property, and environmental resources. 
Multiple scenarios of CoF are generally required in order to properly assess CoF at all points along a 
pipeline.  Scenarios are generated by varying aspects of each of the four CoF categories.  Spill size and 
dispersion are varied by varying the underlying factors such as hole size, detection time, response time, 
ignition potential, and terrain.  Likelihoods of the respective scenarios should also be considered and 
reflected in the risk assessment. 
101 
February 1, 2020 
February 1, 2020  
A key aspect of modern QRA is that units of measurement for all risk assessment inputs and outputs are 
transparent and intuitive.  The following example illustrates this.   
In common applications of the exposure, mitigation, resistance triad, units are as follows.  Each 
exposure is measured in one of two ways – either in units of ‘events per time and distance,’ i.e., 
events/mile-year, events/km-year, etc. or in units of degradation – metal loss or crack growth rates, i.e., 
mpy, mm per year, etc.  An ‘event’ is an occurrence that, in the absence of mitigation and resistance, 
will result in a failure.  To estimate exposure, we envision the component completely unprotected and 
highly vulnerable to failure (think ‘tin can’ wall thickness).  So, an excavator working over a buried 
pipeline is an event.  This is counted as an event regardless of type of excavator, excavator reach, depth 
of burial, use of one-call, signs/markers, etc. 
Mitigation and Resistance are each measured in units of percentage, representing ‘fraction of damage 
or failure scenarios avoided.’  A mitigation effectiveness of 90% means that 9 out of the next 10 
exposures will not result in damage – mitigation has blocked 90% of the exposures that would otherwise 
have occurred.  Resistance of 60% means that 40% of the next damage scenarios will result in failure, 
60% will not. 
For assessing PoF from time-independent failure mechanisms—those that appear random and do not 
worsen over time – the top-level equation can be as simple as: 
PoF_time-independent = exposure x (1 - mitigation) x (1 - resistance) 
With the above example units of measurement, PoF values emerge in intuitive and common units of 
‘events per time and distance’ such as events/mile-year, events/km-year, etc. 
A.D-12.1 PoF Excavator Contacts 
As an example of applying this to failure potential from third party excavations, the following inputs are 
identified for a hypothetical pipeline segment: 
• Exposure (unmitigated) is estimated to be three excavation events per mile-year.   
• Using a mitigation effectiveness analysis, experts estimate that 1 in 50 of these exposures will 
not be successfully kept away from the pipeline by the existing mitigation measures.  This results 
in an overall mitigation effectiveness estimate of 98%. 
• Of the exposures that result in contact with the pipe, despite mitigations, experts perform 
load/stress analyses to estimate that 1 in 4 will result in failure, not just damage.  This estimate 
includes the possible presence of weaknesses due to threat interaction and/or manufacturing 
and construction issues.  So, the pipeline in this area is judged to be 75% resistive to failure from 
these excavation events, if mitigation fails and contact occurs. 
These inputs result in the following assessment: 
(3 excavation events per mile-year) x (1 - 98% mitigated) x (1 - 75% resistive)  
102 
February 1, 2020 
February 1, 2020  
= 0.015 failures per mile-year 87 
This suggests an excavation-related failure about every 67 years along this mile of pipeline. 
This is a very important estimate.  It provides context for decision-makers.  When subsequently coupled 
with consequence potential, it paints a valuable picture of this aspect of risk. 
Note that a useful intermediate calculation, probability of damage (but not failure) also emerges from 
this assessment: 
(3 excavation events per mile-year) x (1 - 98% mitigated) = 0.06 damage events/mile-year  
This suggests excavation-related damage occurring about once every 17 years.   
This damage estimate can be verified by future inspections.  The frequency of new top-side dents or 
gouges, as detected by an ILI, may yield an actual damage rate from excavation activity.  Differences 
between the actual and the estimate can be explored: e.g., if the estimate was too high, was the 
exposure overestimated, mitigation underestimated, or both? This is a valuable learning opportunity. 
A.D-12.2 PoF Corrosion 
This same approach is used for other time-independent failure mechanisms and for all portions of the 
pipeline. 
For assessment of PoF for time-dependent failure mechanisms – those involving degradation of 
materials – the previous algorithms are slightly modified to yield a time-to-failure (TTF) value as an 
intermediate calculation in route to PoF. 
PoF_time-dependent = f(TTF_time-dependent) 
TTF_time-dependent = resistance / [exposure x (1 - mitigation)] 
As an example, experts have determined that, at certain locations along a pipeline, soil corrosivity 
creates a 5 mpy external corrosion exposure (unmitigated).  Examination of coating and cathodic 
protection effectiveness leads experts to assign a mitigation effectiveness of 90%.88   Recent inspections, 
adjusted for uncertainty, result in an ‘effective’ pipe wall thickness estimate of 0.220 inches (resistance).  
This includes allowances for possible weaknesses or susceptibilities, modeled as equivalent to a thinning 
of the pipe wall.89 
Use of these inputs in the PoF assessment is shown below: 
TTF = 220 mils / [5 mpy x (1 - 90%)] = 440 years. 
87  [Exposure vents/mile-yr.] x [damage events/exposure event] x [failures/damage events] = failures/mile-yr. 
88  This is not necessarily a trivial estimate, often requiring significant analyses. 
89  This can be a complex calculation and captures ‘threat interaction’ as noted in a previous column. 
103 
February 1, 2020 
February 1, 2020  
Next, a relationship between TTF and PoF for the future period of interest, is chosen.  For example, a 
simple and conservative relationship yields the following. 
PoF = 1 / TTF = [5 mpy x (1 - 90%)] / 220 mils = 0.22% PoF. 
A.D-12.3 Total PoF 
In this example, an estimate for PoF from the two failure mechanisms examined – excavator damage 
(see Section A.D-12.1) and external corrosion (see Section A.D-12.2) – can be approximated by 1.5% + 
0.2% = 1.7% per mile-year.  If risk management processes deem this to be an actionable level of risk, 
then the exposure-mitigation-resistance details lead the way to risk reduction opportunities. 
The exposure-mitigation-resistance analyses is an indispensable step towards full understanding of PoF.  
Without it, understanding is incomplete.  Full understanding leads to the best risk management practice – optimized resource allocation – which benefits all stakeholders.

Appendix E – Regulatory Drivers90 
The requirements for hazardous liquid pipelines are found in § 195.452 (Pipeline integrity 
management in high consequence areas): 
§ 195.452 (f) What are the elements of an integrity management program?  
An integrity management program begins with the initial framework.  An operator must 
continually change the program to reflect operating experience, conclusions drawn from 
results of the integrity assessments, and other maintenance and surveillance data, and 
evaluation of consequences of a failure on the high consequence area.  An operator must 
include, at minimum, each of the following elements in its written integrity management 
program: … (3) An analysis that integrates all available information about the integrity of the 
entire pipeline and the consequences of a failure (see paragraph (g) of this section); … 
§ 195.452 (g) What is an information analysis?  
In periodically evaluating the integrity of each pipeline segment (paragraph (j) of this 
section), an operator must analyze all available information about the integrity of the entire 
pipeline and the consequences of a failure.  This information includes: 
(1) Information critical to determining the potential for, and preventing, damage due to 
excavation, including current and planned damage prevention activities, and 
development or planned development along the pipeline segment; 
(2) Data gathered through the integrity assessment required under this section; 
(3) Data gathered in conjunction with other inspections, tests, surveillance and patrols 
required by this Part, including, corrosion control monitoring and cathodic protection 
surveys; and 
(4) Information about how a failure would affect the high consequence area, such as 
location of the water intake. 
§ 195.452 (h) What actions must an operator take to address integrity issues? —  
… (4) Special requirements for scheduling remediation— 
… (iv) Other conditions.  In addition to the conditions listed in paragraphs (h)(4)(i) 
through (iii) of this section, an operator must evaluate any condition identified by an 
90  Regulatory references are those in effect as of the date of this document. 
105 
February 1, 2020 
February 1, 2020  
integrity assessment or information analysis that could impair the integrity of the 
pipeline, and as appropriate, schedule the condition for remediation. 
§ 195.452 (i) What preventive and mitigative measures must an operator take to protect the 
high consequence area? — 
(1) General requirements.  An operator must take measures to prevent and mitigate the 
consequences of a pipeline failure that could affect a high consequence area.  These 
measures include conducting a risk analysis of the pipeline segment to identify additional 
actions to enhance public safety or environmental protection.   
(2) Risk analysis criteria.  In identifying the need for additional preventive and mitigative 
measures, an operator must evaluate the likelihood of a pipeline release occurring and how 
a release could affect the high consequence area.  This determination must consider all 
relevant risk factors, including, but not limited to: 
(i) Terrain surrounding the pipeline segment, including drainage systems such as small 
streams and other smaller waterways that could act as a conduit to the high 
consequence area; 
(ii) Elevation profile; 
(iii) Characteristics of the product transported; 
(iv) Amount of product that could be released; 
(v) Possibility of a spillage in a farm field following the drain tile into a waterway; 
(vi) Ditches along-side a roadway the pipeline crosses; 
(vii) Physical support of the pipeline segment such as by a cable suspension bridge; 
(viii) Exposure of the pipeline to operating pressure exceeding established maximum 
operating pressure. 
§ 195.452 (j) What is a continual process of evaluation and assessment to maintain a pipeline's 
integrity? — 
… (2) Evaluation.  An operator must conduct a periodic evaluation as frequently as needed to 
assure pipeline integrity.  An operator must base the frequency of evaluation on risk factors 
specific to its pipeline, including the factors specified in paragraph (e) of this section.  The 
evaluation must consider the results of the baseline and periodic integrity assessments, 
information analysis (paragraph (g) of this section), and decisions about remediation, and 
preventive and mitigative actions (paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section). 
(3) Assessment intervals.  An operator must establish five-year intervals, not to exceed 68 
months, for continually assessing the line pipe's integrity.  An operator must base the 
106 
February 1, 2020 
February 1, 2020  
assessment intervals on the risk the line pipe poses to the high consequence area to 
determine the priority for assessing the pipeline segments.  An operator must establish the 
assessment intervals based on the factors specified in paragraph (e) of this section, the 
analysis of the results from the last integrity assessment, and the information analysis 
required by paragraph (g) of this section. 
The requirements for gas transmission pipelines are found in respective portions of 49 CFR Part 
192, Subpart O (Gas Transmission Pipeline Integrity Management): 
§ 192.911 What are the elements of an integrity management program? 
An operator's initial integrity management program begins with a framework (see 
§ 192.907) and evolves into a more detailed and comprehensive integrity management 
program, as information is gained and incorporated into the program.  An operator must 
make continual improvements to its program.  The initial program framework and 
subsequent program must, at minimum, contain the following elements.  (When indicated, 
refer to ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) for more detailed 
information on the listed element.) 
(c) An identification of threats to each covered pipeline segment, which must include 
data integration and a risk assessment.  An operator must use the threat identification 
and risk assessment to prioritize covered segments for assessment (§ 192.917) and to 
evaluate the merits of additional preventive and mitigative measures (§ 192.935) for 
each covered segment. 
§ 192.917 How does an operator identify potential threats to pipeline integrity and use the 
threat identification in its integrity program? 
(a) Threat identification.  An operator must identify and evaluate all potential threats to 
each covered pipeline segment.  Potential threats that an operator must consider include, 
but are not limited to, the threats listed in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, 
see § 192.7), section 2, which are grouped under the following four categories: 
(1) Time dependent threats such as internal corrosion, external corrosion, and stress 
corrosion cracking; 
(2) Static or resident threats, such as fabrication or construction defects; 
(3) Time independent threats such as third party damage and outside force damage; and 
(4) Human error. 
(b) Data gathering and integration.  To identify and evaluate the potential threats to a 
covered pipeline segment, an operator must gather and integrate existing data and 
107 
February 1, 2020 
February 1, 2020  
information on the entire pipeline that could be relevant to the covered segment.  In 
performing this data gathering and integration, an operator must follow the requirements in 
ASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 4.  At a minimum, an operator must gather and evaluate the set 
of data specified in Appendix A to ASME/ANSI B31.8S, and consider both on the covered 
segment and similar non-covered segments, past incident history, corrosion control records, 
continuing surveillance records, patrolling records, maintenance history, internal inspection 
records and all other conditions specific to each pipeline. 
(c) Risk assessment.  An operator must conduct a risk assessment that follows ASME/ANSI 
B31.8S, section 5, and considers the identified threats for each covered segment.  An 
operator must use the risk assessment to prioritize the covered segments for the baseline 
and continual reassessments (§§ 192.919, 192.921, and 192.937), and to determine what 
additional preventive and mitigative measures are needed (§ 192.935) for the covered 
segment. 
§ 192.935 What additional preventive and mitigative measures must an operator take? 
(a) General requirements.  An operator must take additional measures beyond those already 
required by Part 192 to prevent a pipeline failure and to mitigate the consequences of a 
pipeline failure in a high consequence area.  An operator must base the additional measures 
on the threats the operator has identified to each pipeline segment.  (See § 192.917) An 
operator must conduct, in accordance with one of the risk assessment approaches in 
ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), section 5, a risk analysis of its 
pipeline to identify additional measures to protect the high consequence area and enhance 
public safety.  Such additional measures include, but are not limited to, installing Automatic 
Shut-off Valves or Remote Control Valves, installing computerized monitoring and leak 
detection systems, replacing pipe segments with pipe of heavier wall thickness, providing 
additional training to personnel on response procedures, conducting drills with local 
emergency responders and implementing additional inspection and maintenance 
programs…. 
§ 192.937 What is a continual process of evaluation and assessment to maintain a pipeline's 
integrity? ... 
(b) Evaluation.  An operator must conduct a periodic evaluation as frequently as needed to 
assure the integrity of each covered segment.  The periodic evaluation must be based on a 
data integration and risk assessment of the entire pipeline as specified in § 192.917.  For 
plastic transmission pipelines, the periodic evaluation is based on the threat analysis 
specified in § 192.917(d).  For all other transmission pipelines, the evaluation must consider 
the past and present integrity assessment results, data integration and risk assessment 
information (§ 192.917), and decisions about remediation (§ 192.933) and additional 
preventive and mitigative actions (§ 192.935).  An operator must use the results from this 
108 
February 1, 2020 
February 1, 2020  
evaluation to identify the threats specific to each covered segment and the risk represented 
by these threats. 
(c) Assessment methods.  In conducting the integrity reassessment, an operator must assess 
the integrity of the line pipe in the covered segment by any of the following methods as 
appropriate for the threats to which the covered segment is susceptible (see § 192.917), or 
by confirmatory direct assessment under the conditions specified in § 192.931. 
§ 192.939 What are the required reassessment intervals? 
An operator must comply with the following requirements in establishing the reassessment 
interval for the operator's covered pipeline segments. 
(a) Pipelines operating at or above 30% SMYS.  An operator must establish a reassessment 
interval for each covered segment operating at or above 30% SMYS in accordance with the 
requirements of this section.  The maximum reassessment interval by an allowable 
reassessment method is seven years.  If an operator establishes a reassessment interval that 
is greater than seven years, the operator must, within the seven-year period, conduct a 
confirmatory direct assessment on the covered segment, and then conduct the follow-up 
reassessment at the interval the operator has established.  A reassessment carried out using 
confirmatory direct assessment must be done in accordance with §192.931.  The table that 
follows this section sets forth the maximum allowed reassessment intervals. 
(1) Pressure test or internal inspection or other equivalent technology.  An operator that 
uses pressure testing or internal inspection as an assessment method must establish the 
reassessment interval for a covered pipeline segment by— 
(i) Basing the interval on the identified threats for the covered segment (see 
§ 192.917) and on the analysis of the results from the last integrity assessment and 
from the data integration and risk assessment required by § 192.917; or 
(ii) Using the intervals specified for different stress levels of pipeline (operating at or 
above 30% SMYS) listed in ASME B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), 
section 5, Table 3.
